# Current State

## MESP-132 Finance foundation implementation handoff - 24 August 2026

MESP-132 is the active bounded implementation capability under Finance Epic
MESP-10. Jira activation is already recorded (`MESP-132` comment `11845`,
`MESP-10` comment `11844`); MESP-131 closure is `11842` and MESP-8 closure
is `11843`. This session performed no Jira writes, did not invoke Claude
Opus 5, and did not create an Opus review prompt.

### Delivered architecture

- Finance books are Company/legal-entity scoped inside trusted Tenant scope;
  functional currency is Company configuration, not a universal Tenant rule.
- The Company-owned COA has normalized Company-unique codes, Asset/Liability/
  Equity/Revenue/Expense types, hierarchy and cycle guards, grouping versus
  posting eligibility, effective dates, lifecycle, concurrency, and historical
  account code/name snapshots.
- Finance owns the configured Fiscal Calendar, explicit Fiscal Years, and
  non-overlapping Fiscal Periods. Periods are Draft/Open/SoftClosed/Closed;
  posting-date resolution is exact and Closed/SoftClosed posting fails closed.
  No retained-earnings, automatic P&L close, carry-forward, or opening journal
  mechanic was invented.
- Cost Center is the only bounded Finance posting dimension. Repository
  inspection found terminology/BRD references but no existing persisted Master
  Data Cost Center to reuse, so the narrow Company-applicable structure is
  Finance-owned and lifecycle/effective validation is server-side.
- Journals and lines implement Draft/Submitted/Approved/Rejected/Cancelled/
  Posted/Reversed, exact one-sided line rules, functional-currency balance,
  immutable Posted facts, controlled equal-and-opposite reversal, and bounded
  GL inquiry derived from Posted Journal Lines.
- Posting Rules are Company-owned, versioned, effective-dated, explicitly
  enabled/disabled, and map one source/event to debit/credit accounts and
  required Cost Center. Missing or ambiguous mappings fail closed.
- Foreign currency preserves transaction facts and validates exact active
  MESP-120 Exchange Rate identity/version/number/rate/effective window and
  direct currency pair; no inverse/latest/browser/external rate is accepted.
- Finance consumes `inventory-valuation-finance.v1` ReadyForFinance evidence,
  applies deterministic configured mapping, records source-to-GL uniqueness,
  and never mutates Inventory.
- Trusted Tenant/Company authorization, exact operation permissions, reusable
  approval/SoD seams, antiforgery, Idempotency-Key replay, If-Match versions,
  Serializable writes, safe Problem Details and audit evidence are enforced.
- Lazy Angular `/app/finance` provides Company-selected COA, periods, journals,
  rules, handoff and GL views in EN/AR with RTL and no raw GUID entry.

### Validation evidence

- Focused Finance foundation: `5/5`.
- REST/OpenAPI and host-security subset: `52/52`.
- Prior Inventory regression: `89/89`.
- SQL Server safety: `41/41` against disposable LocalDB (one new Finance
  schema/ownership uniqueness case over the accepted `40/40` baseline).
- Full backend wrapper: `969/969`, 0 failed, 0 skipped; disposable database
  was torn down by the wrapper and the runtime connection was unchanged.
- Release build: 0 warnings, 0 errors. Finance migration model-change check:
  `No changes have been made to the model since the last migration.`
- Angular: `258/258` across 37 spec files; initial bundle `496.34 kB`; Finance
  lazy chunk `36.60 kB`; focused Finance Chromium `2/2`; full Chromium `34/34`;
  both npm audits report 0 vulnerabilities.
- Finance migration Designer contains a populated `BuildTargetModel`.
  `frontend/assets` has zero changes.

### Scope and next step

AP/AR, invoices, payments, cash/bank, tax/VAT/ZATCA/FATOORA, financial
statements, generic Reporting, Sales, year-end retained-earnings mechanics,
consolidation/intercompany, fixed assets, payroll, treasury, budgeting,
automated FX/revaluation, production migration/cutover, external providers,
statutory certification, and Wafra-specific Finance behavior remain deferred.

Sol accepts the exact final branch SHA and the single Draft PR. No next Finance
task starts automatically and no Opus prompt is added.

### Final runtime verification

The official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` launcher was run
after the final Release build with the explicit loopback-only Development auth
bypass. Backend `http://localhost:5300` is PID `41320`; `/health` returned
HTTP 200. Frontend `http://localhost:4300` is PID `5432`; `/`, `/main.js`, and
`/app/finance` each returned HTTP 200. Both repository-owned processes remain
running for Owner inspection and no credential was printed or persisted.

## Historical MESP-131 guarded merge state - 24 August 2026

PR #75 is merged into `main` at exact squash SHA
`a8664d6a0d006e463a1a03fadd76c28475475f58`. The approved feature head was
`db624fbb71d15ee55022e247df0f83894d026257`, from pre-merge main base
`b470179e1d18ef75c0a9247b2340407da6220dc4`. Post-merge Release build passed
with 0 warnings and 0 errors; focused MESP-131 valuation passed `44/44`; the
combined Inventory regression passed `89/89`. The official merged-main runtime
is backend `http://localhost:5300` PID `26856` and frontend
`http://localhost:4300` PID `39044`; `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js` returned
HTTP 200. `frontend/assets` is untouched.

Sol owns Jira closure, MESP-8 reconciliation, and evaluation/activation of
MESP-132. No Jira writes or MESP-132 implementation were performed. The Opus
critical checkpoint was completed once; no second Opus review is required.
Both P1 findings were remediated and Sol-accepted; four Opus P2 observations
remain deferred as recorded in `TASK.md`.

<!-- MESP-131-JIRA-SYNC-START -->

## Current authoritative position - 24 August 2026 (MESP-131 final P1 correction-quantity remediation; Sol acceptance handoff)

MESP-131 is implemented on branch
`feat/MESP-131-mwa-valuation-reconciliation`, created from the exact required
main base `b470179e1d18ef75c0a9247b2340407da6220dc4` and exact migration-repair
session start `48ddf07a645da0130699314243ae8b23907b3bfc`. The pre-repair
implementation baseline is `42794bda13bada7f37dcbf6ef6b8cc8e73eba889`; Draft
PR #75 is merged into `main` at the guarded-merge squash SHA recorded above.
The final P1 correction-quantity
source/test commit is `64c4f4ea9b917119d07cb26df7ecac8c2239bfac`; the final
documentation handoff tip is reported with the completion response after this
state update. Jira finding source is comment `11835` and Sol hold is comment
`11839`; Jira is read-only for this session and no Jira writes were performed.

The bounded capability establishes a durable Company-scoped `LedgerSequence`
for every Inventory movement-producing path, deterministically bootstraps
legacy movement order, and never uses `PostedAt` or `EffectiveDate` as the
ordering authority. The original migration is
`20260823124304_MESP131MovingWeightedAverageValuation`; additive remediation
migration `20260823180537_MESP131SolFinancialIntegrityRemediation` adds the
pool-identity, policy-lineage/version, pending-evidence, and Finance
direction/sign corrections. Existing MESP-130 and original MESP-131 migration
content is unchanged.

The final EF migration Designer artifact was repaired through the actual EF
tooling. The malformed
`20260823211902_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity.Designer.cs` had an empty
`BuildTargetModel`; it was replaced by the regenerated
`20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity` migration and populated
Designer. Its exact additive delta is nullable `decimal(28,8)`
`FormulaMovementValue` and `RoundingAdjustmentAmount` on
`inventory.MovementValuationEvents`, plus required/default-zero
`decimal(28,8)` `RoundingAdjustmentAmount` on
`inventory.FinanceValuationHandoffs`. The two preceding migrations are
byte-for-byte unchanged. One SQL safety regression now proves the final target
model and snapshot are populated.

The valuation contract is policy-versioned and Tenant-safe: decimal Moving
Weighted Average with configured quantity/unit-cost/amount scales and
ToEven/AwayFromZero rounding; Company/Branch/Warehouse/Product/UOM and
optional tracking scope; active Master Data functional-currency identity;
Purchase Order unit price for Goods Receipt; current MWA or linked receipt for
Supplier Return; current MWA for configured positive adjustments/count
variance; exact active effective-dated MESP-120 exchange-rate snapshots for
opening/source costs; and explicit Pending/Blocked diagnostics. Applied
events are immutable and source/line/rate/policy linked. Pending predecessors
stop later valuation in the same scope; backdated events are applied in
LedgerSequence order with explicit `backdated_applied` evidence.

Authoritative state and scope-anchor identity is the physical valuation pool,
not PolicyId: Tenant/Company/Branch/Warehouse/Product/UOM and TrackingIdentity
only when the selected policy scope includes tracking. Compatible policy
versions carry state and record current policy metadata; incompatible currency,
scope, precision, or rounding transitions fail closed for rebaseline.

Opening Balance, Goods Receipt, Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count Variance,
Stock Issue, Supplier Return, Customer Return boundary, and Warehouse
Transfer shipment/receipt/loss/return seams are represented. Transfer receipts
inherit shipment valuation and unresolved shipment evidence remains Pending.
Customer Return without authoritative original delivery valuation remains
Pending. Physical corrections append a source-linked reversal event with a
signed movement value; authoritative source-revision correction persistence is
an explicit provider-required seam and never fabricates revised cost.

The Opus P1 remediation now fails closed when a drifted full correction would
produce zero quantity with residual value, using
`correction_would_orphan_residual_value`. The correction is persisted as
Blocked evidence, only its derived valuation scope is stopped, later movement
in that scope receives `pending_predecessor`, and unrelated same-Company pools
continue. MWA quantity input/prior/new/correction arithmetic and reconciliation
quantity differences preserve exact physical Stock Ledger `decimal(28,8)`
facts; `AmountScale` is monetary-only. No QuantityScale or schema migration was
introduced. The four Opus P2 observations remain deferred.

The final P1 delta removes the remaining monetary-rounding defect from
`TryApplyCorrection`: correction quantities now preserve exact physical
`decimal(28,8)` arithmetic for both inbound and outbound directions. A direct
calculator regression and a product-reachable SAR Stock Adjustment correction
regression prove `1.005 - 0.001 = 1.004`, truthful outbound Finance handoff
facts (`0.001`, `100.00`, `0.10`, `-0.10`), final state `1.004 / 100.40 / 100.00`,
and exact `Reconciled` status. `AmountScale` remains monetary-only, with no
QuantityScale, tolerance, schema, or migration change.

Inventory-owned reconciliation compares physical quantity with durable
valuation state and reports applied/pending/blocked counts, policy/currency,
latest physical and valued sequences, oldest pending sequence, in-transit
quantity/value, Finance handoff state, as-of, and freshness without a
balancing plug. The dedicated Warehouse summary aggregates Products, labels
partial/incomplete value truthfully, and exposes no warehouse AverageUnitCost;
detailed reconciliation retains per-Product MWA. Current-state reconciliation
accepts only safe current-scope filters. Summary/history/pending-blocked/
reconciliation/in-transit/correction-history views and bounded audited CSV
export remain available. Finance receives immutable valuation facts through
`inventory-valuation-finance.v1`; Inventory creates no journal, GL, AP, AR,
tax, payment, or period-posting artifact.

REST/OpenAPI operations are catalogue-backed and server-context authorized;
mutations require antiforgery, Idempotency-Key, correlation, audit, and safe
errors. Company/Branch/Warehouse authorization is server-derived and client
Tenant identifiers are never authoritative. Process and correction fingerprints
are deterministic SHA-256 values bounded for SQL storage; existing Inventory
idempotency provides exact replay and conflict outcomes, including policy
creation, and first-scope uniqueness races are safe conflicts. The Angular
valuation area is lazy-loaded, extends the existing Inventory feature, and is
EN/AR with RTL support; no product source assets were changed.

Validation after the final P1 correction-quantity delta: focused MESP-131
valuation `44/44`, combined Inventory regression `89/89`, SQL Server safety
`40/40` against disposable LocalDB, disposable LocalDB full backend `963/963` with zero
failures/skips, model-change detection clean, isolated
Release solution build `0` warnings/`0` errors, Angular
`254/254` across 35 spec files, focused Chromium `5/5`, full Chromium `32/32`,
both npm audits `0` vulnerabilities, production initial bundle `499.94 kB`,
and valuation lazy chunk `35.96 kB`.

The official launcher restarted the merged-main runtime on backend
`http://localhost:5300` PID `26856` and frontend `http://localhost:4300` PID
`39044`. `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js` each returned HTTP 200; both
repository-owned processes remain alive for Owner inspection. The explicit
loopback-only Development auth bypass was used without printing credentials.

The overall Production-Ready Completion headline remains approximately 47%
overall and 41% Procurement/P2P; the merge does not change production
readiness. Fast-track capability completion is now 15/26 = 57.7%, not
production readiness.
No MESP-132, Finance GL/AP/AR, Sales, generic Reporting, migration/cutover,
external/statutory, or Wafra-specific core implementation was started. The
next exact action is Sol governance closure of merged MESP-131 and evaluation
of MESP-132 activation. No Opus prompt is created by this handoff.

## Current authoritative position - 23 August 2026 (MESP-130 final ledger-fence remediation complete; Sol acceptance handoff)

MESP-129 is Done. MESP-130 remains In Progress pending Sol acceptance. The
final ledger-fence remediation is pushed on branch
`feat/MESP-130-stock-control-corrections`, starting from the exact bounded
session SHA `9f5950848217bb992df7770baf93a91fa67b24ca`, with main base
`6f6d204726cc4baf9979961ea6936c0d03e93e32`. The ledger-fence source,
regression, and formal migration commit is
`e63bcb3736138d3b3fb57ccd06646b6caf943e75`. Draft PR #74 remains Open,
Draft, and unmerged. Jira was read-only; no Jira writes were performed.

The Full Count path now establishes a `long` warehouse movement-cardinality
fence inside the Serializable transaction before authoritative identity
discovery, so a concurrent movement that would introduce a new identity is
blocked until the fence and identity snapshot are complete. Cycle Count remains
selected-identity scoped and records a `long` cardinality for each selected
identity; unrelated movement remains irrelevant. Durable append-only
`inventory.CountSnapshots` rows preserve cutoff/cardinality evidence for every
count generation, while count lines preserve identity cardinality. Recount and
resnapshot add new generation evidence without overwriting prior rounds.
Posting now compares durable generation cardinality against live ledger counts
and fails closed to `ResnapshotRequired`; `PostedAt > SnapshotCutoff` is no
longer the stale-detection authority. Missing generation evidence also fails
closed. The additive migration is
`20260823104702_MESP130InventoryCountLedgerFence`.

The SQL Server regressions execute the actual Full/Cycle reader, pause after
reader execution, prove the insert attempt is blocked while the count
transaction holds its range fence, release and commit, and prove the resulting
older-`PostedAt` movement cannot silently pass posting. Full Count proves a new
Product B identity is absent from the original snapshot and requires a
resnapshot; Cycle Count proves selected-identity invalidation and unrelated
identity irrelevance.

Validation at the pushed source commit: Release build `0` warnings / `0`
errors; focused Inventory `12/12`; SQL safety `32/32` through disposable
LocalDB; full backend `911/911` passed with `0` failed and `0` skipped; Angular
`246/246` across 33 spec files; focused MESP-130 Chromium `1/1`; full Chromium
`27/27`; both npm audits `0` vulnerabilities; production initial bundle
`499.81 kB`, Inventory lazy `90.11 kB`, Supplier Quotation lazy `91.94 kB`;
and `git diff --check` clean for the source delta. Owner-managed
`frontend/assets` remains untouched.

The official launcher restarted the final runtime on backend
`http://localhost:5300` PID `31576` and frontend `http://localhost:4300` PID
`40296`. `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js` each returned HTTP 200, and both
repository-owned processes were verified alive and left running. The explicit
loopback-only Development auth bypass was used without printing or persisting
credentials. Production readiness remains approximately 47% overall and 41%
Procurement/P2P; this bounded correctness remediation does not increase the
headline pending Sol acceptance/merge. No MESP-131, Finance, Sales, Reporting,
migration/cutover, external, statutory, or Wafra-specific core behavior was
added. The next exact action is Sol acceptance of the final branch tip and
Draft PR #74; no Opus prompt is created by this handoff.

## Superseded pre-ledger-fence position - 23 August 2026 (MESP-130 Sol remediation complete; delta acceptance handoff)

MESP-129 is Done. MESP-130 Sol acceptance remediation is implemented at its
bounded Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count, Stock Issue, and eligible correction
scope on branch `feat/MESP-130-stock-control-corrections`, from the exact
required start SHA `fd3db1ae842f3abba1cb4880200b6b6dac5f379d` and main base
`6f6d204726cc4baf9979961ea6936c0d03e93e32`. The remediation implementation
commit is `3320cf284d64a58be7fb0f00ac654ee7a11d7b00`. Draft PR #74 remains Open,
Draft, and unmerged. Jira is read-only; no Jira writes were performed.

P1 remediation now persists correct distinct current-stage approval state for
Adjustment and Stock Issue, applies configured count-variance approval without
inventing a threshold, enforces a true blind counter contract and post-observation
variance reason, establishes count cutoffs after anchored expected resolution,
invalidates Full Count on any same-warehouse post-cutoff identity, preserves
prior rounds during full resnapshot, and provides a durable one-correction-per-
original-movement database backstop. P2 remediation adds the high-risk
regressions, completes the bounded existing Stock Control workspace with reason
catalogue/history/correction/recount/rejection controls, restores the bundle
budget, and aligns reason update validation with create invariants.

The immutable MESP-128 ledger, deterministic anchors, Serializable posting,
reservation protection, MESP-129 physical history, Tenant and operational-context
authorization, idempotency, audit/history, REST/OpenAPI, and formal Inventory
migrations remain authoritative. New MESP-130 movements remain `Pending`
valuation. MESP-131 owns MWA; no Finance, GL, AP, AR, tax, payment, Sales,
Reporting, external, statutory, migration/cutover, or Wafra-specific core
behavior was added. Return-for-change is not exposed in the bounded UI because
there is no edit/resubmit contract; unsupported physical sources remain
uncorrectable. Owner-managed `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

Validation: focused Inventory/MESP-130 `10/10`; SQL Server safety `31/31`
through disposable LocalDB; full backend `908/908` passed with 0 failed and 0
skipped; Angular `246/246` across 33 spec files; focused MESP-130 Chromium
`1/1`; full Chromium `27/27`; both npm audits report 0 vulnerabilities;
production initial bundle `499.81 kB`, Inventory lazy chunk `90.11 kB`,
Supplier Quotation lazy chunk `91.94 kB`; final Release build
`0` warnings/`0` errors. `git diff --check` is clean before the documentation
handoff commit.

The mandatory runtime is `http://localhost:5300` backend PID `20036` and
`http://localhost:4300` frontend PID `34964`; `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js`
returned HTTP 200 and both processes remain alive. The supported loopback-only
Development bypass was used without printing credentials. Production-readiness
remains approximately 47% overall and 41% Procurement/P2P pending Sol
acceptance and merge. MESP-130 remains In Progress. The next exact action is
Sol delta acceptance of the final branch tip; do not start MESP-131 or
downstream implementation.

## Current authoritative position - 22 August 2026 (MESP-129 OPUS P1 remediation complete; Sol delta handoff)

MESP-129 remains bounded to its Inventory physical-movement capability on
branch `feat/MESP-129-physical-stock-movements`, based exactly on synchronized
main `2cf6b315c69c87f26ca4bbfc774e3e0eb451c5e3`. This remediation started from
the exact synchronized local/remote branch SHA
`b5a0aaca856d571089c65d341de4b8e19205793d`; the bounded P1 implementation and
regression commit is `a824e8a`. Draft PR #73 is open, Draft, and unmerged.
Jira remains read-only; no Jira writes were performed.

The P1 defect was cumulative Supplier Return outbound-capacity validation when
multiple commercial return lines resolve to one identical Company/Branch/
Warehouse/Product/UOM/TrackingIdentity stock key. The correction resolves
OnHand and active Reserved once per distinct stock identity, stages cumulative
outbound quantity by identity, validates every aggregate before creating any
movement, and preserves one immutable movement per Supplier Return line with
full Supplier Return/Goods Receipt/Purchase Order lineage. Serializable
transactions and the existing MESP-128 anchors remain unchanged.

Executable regressions cover two-line same-identity over-capacity rejection,
reservation protection, and exact-boundary success. Failure cases prove no
Supplier Return movement, success replay, success audit, or Procurement
handoff effect; the success case proves two separate line-level movements and
`OnHand = Reserved = 5` after a 15-unit outbound from 20 units.

The current Supplier Return physical/commercial lifecycle gate is a
process-local `ConcurrentDictionary<Guid, SemaphoreSlim>` and is valid only
with exactly one active API process. Horizontal API scale-out is not approved
while it is the only cross-module lifecycle coordinator; before multiple API
instances are enabled, durable cross-instance coordination must replace or
supplement it. This is specific to the current MESP-129 Supplier Return
coordination and does not change MESP-128 stock concurrency anchors or state
that the whole ERP can never scale out.

Validation is Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused Inventory 33/33;
focused Goods Receipt/Supplier Return 23/23; SQL safety 29/29 through the
canonical disposable LocalDB runner; canonical backend 896/896 passed, 0
skipped; Angular 241/241 across 32 spec files; production bundle 499.97 kB
initial with Inventory lazy 33.12 kB and Supplier Quotation lazy 91.94 kB;
Chromium 26/26; both npm audits 0 vulnerabilities; official launcher runtime
API `http://localhost:5300` PID 26432 and frontend `http://localhost:4300` PID
22280 are alive, with `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js` returning HTTP 200; and
`git diff --check` is clean. Protected `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

The production headline remains approximately 47% overall and 41%
Procurement/P2P because this is a bounded correctness remediation. The next
exact step is Sol targeted delta acceptance of the final branch SHA; do not
merge or start MESP-130, MESP-131, commercial Sales, Finance, or downstream
implementation.

## Historical MESP-129 Sol acceptance remediation position - 22 August 2026

MESP-129 is code-complete at its bounded Inventory physical-movement scope on
branch `feat/MESP-129-physical-stock-movements`, based exactly on synchronized
main `2cf6b315c69c87f26ca4bbfc774e3e0eb451c5e3`. The code-complete
implementation commit is `01ea8f7369d173c15cf55a723d6bd95006208282`; Draft PR
#73 is open, Draft, and unmerged. Jira remains read-only; no Jira writes were
performed. The final Sol blocker remediation started from the exact
synchronized local/remote branch head
`380e104292523fe7930493263ed043d6d354d685`; the verified remediation source
commit `cf40f97c70603bd90996dc4567e2a3215f317c7b` is pushed; the final
handoff/tracker tip is recorded in the completion report.

The implementation consumes the authoritative Procurement Goods Receipt source
through an application/provider contract. Only accepted quantity creates one
immutable inbound Inventory movement per Goods Receipt line; rejected quantity
never enters stock, duplicate source posts converge, and Goods Receipt
cancellation is blocked while an active Inventory effect exists. Supplier
Return physical posting is restricted to the real `AwaitingInventory` source,
preserves Supplier Return/line, Goods Receipt/line, and Purchase Order/line
lineage, respects `OnHand >= Reserved`, uses durable source uniqueness and
idempotent replay, emits duplicate audit evidence, and converges a retry after
physical commit with the Procurement handoff seam. A commercial reversal after
physical posting remains blocked by the upstream state contract; no silent
physical disagreement is allowed.

Inventory owns Warehouse Transfer. Direct transfers commit balanced source
outbound and destination inbound effects atomically. Two-step transfers commit
source shipment first, derive InTransit from immutable transfer events, support
partial receipt, reject overage, resolve explicit shortage/loss without a
second outbound movement, and permit cancellation only before physical
shipment. Source and destination warehouses are resolved and authorized
server-side, must be active, distinct, same-Tenant, and same-Company; both
warehouse authorities are required for reads and mutations. Existing
MESP-128 concurrency anchors and Serializable transactions are retained with
deterministic multi-identity lock ordering.

New physical movements carry `Pending` valuation and nullable cost/currency
when no authoritative Inventory valuation exists; MESP-131 owns later MWA
valuation. No AP, AR, GL, tax, payment, commercial Sales Customer Return,
MESP-130 Count/Adjustment/Stock Issue, external/statutory, or Wafra-specific
behavior was added. Customer Return is only a truthful unavailable Inventory
integration boundary awaiting an authoritative Sales handoff; no arbitrary
client-supplied posting exists.

The formal Inventory migration is
`20260822092802_MESP129PhysicalStockMovements`; it adds only MESP-129 Inventory
physical tables/columns and preserves Tenancy migration ownership. The SQL
safety fixture applies real committed Tenancy, Master Data, Business
Parties, Procurement, and Inventory migrations in order to one disposable
LocalDB catalog with separate history tables, and checks the shared
Tenant-owned table/index topology plus expected Inventory tables.

The six prior Sol acceptance remediations plus the final P1/P2 blocker delta are
complete: tracked Procurement sources
fail closed without tracking identity fabrication; Goods Receipt cancellation
has active/no-effect/unavailable verification and preserves state on
unavailability; Supplier Return replay probes durable Inventory before source
eligibility and converges after Procurement handoff; duplicate transfer receipt
references converge with audit evidence and no second movement; receipt
mutations acquire the MESP-128 destination anchor; and the migration-order test
uses one real disposable catalog without `EnsureCreated`. REST/OpenAPI/
Foundation metadata, antiforgery, ETags/If- นmatch, idempotency, audit/history,

## Current authoritative position - 22 August 2026 (MESP-128 Opus stock-integrity delta remediation complete; delta-only review handoff)

MESP-128 remains bounded to the Inventory-owned physical-stock foundation on
branch `feat/MESP-128-inventory-ledger-foundation`, based exactly on main
`f54b6abe383edd304911eb0a53db43fafdcb3066`. This bounded delta session started
from the synchronized branch head
`7e1df0f9a4f27f9f7e0dad91170accd8247c8236`; implementation commit
`3a419377bfa09047f5b849020f8a6dc793bc868c` contains the bounded source,
migration, and regression changes. Draft PR #72 remains open,
Draft, and unmerged. Jira remains read-only; no Jira writes were performed.

The business opening-source fingerprint now excludes `ExtractedAt`, while
retaining extraction time as immutable evidence. Therefore identical business
provenance with different extraction timestamps is still one duplicate and
cannot post twice; distinct stable `SourceLineReference` values remain
distinct. The bounded single-row Angular workspace requires the user source
reference and sends that same value as the row source-line reference, with no
invented `line-1`. Future multi-row import UI must carry stable source-line
references from its source context.

SQL Server contention classification is narrow: only errors 1205 and 1222,
including nested provider exceptions, become the existing conflict/HTTP 409
outcome. Genuine persistence failures remain unavailable/HTTP 503. Shared
stock-identity anchors retain Serializable locking and now perform a real
provider-independent mutable `TouchSequence` write; SQL Server receives an
actual UPDATE and SQLite exercises the same seam. The nullable-Branch unique
stock-identity index is explicitly unfiltered, so SQL Server enforces repeated
`BranchId IS NULL` identities.

The formal additive Inventory migration history now includes
`20260821113311_MESP128InventoryLedgerFoundation`,
`20260821132738_MESP128StockIntegrityRemediation`, and
`20260821213832_MESP128OpusStockIntegrityRemediation`. REST/OpenAPI/Foundation
metadata, Tenant query filters, audit/history, durable replay/conflict,
SQLite compatibility, and the bilingual EN/AR RTL workspace remain intact.
The existing Product `TrackingEnabled` boolean remains the complete tracking
rule; batch/lot/serial/manufacturing/expiry mode enforcement remains an
upstream Product-model limitation.

Validation is clean: Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused Inventory
coverage 17/17; SQL Server safety coverage 26/26; canonical full backend
871/871 passed, 0 skipped with disposable LocalDB safety execution; Angular
241/241 across 32 spec files; production initial bundle 499.97 kB with
Inventory lazy chunk 25.82 kB; focused Chromium 2/2; full Chromium 26/26;
both npm audits 0 vulnerabilities; disposable SQL migration apply, rollback,
reapply, and drop all succeeded; and final git diff --check is clean.
Protected `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

Headline production percentages remain unchanged at approximately 47% overall
and 41% Procurement/P2P because this is correctness remediation, not new
headline scope. No Goods Receipt authoritative Inventory posting, Warehouse
Transfer, InTransit lifecycle, Supplier/Customer Return physical posting,
Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count, Stock Issue, MWA valuation, AP/AR/GL, tax
accounting, payment, external/statutory, production cutover, DNS/TLS, supplier
portal, or Wafra-specific core behavior was added. MESP-129 and all downstream
implementation remain unstarted. The next independent review is delta-only;
do not merge or start downstream implementation from this handoff.

## Current authoritative position - 21 August 2026 (MESP-127 Supplier Return implementation complete; Sol acceptance handoff)

MESP-127 is implementation-complete at its bounded Procurement-owned scope on
branch `feat/MESP-127-supplier-return-corrections`, based exactly on
`e5568c1ea186995dcc4f0cb0075b2f6b20a15064`. The completing implementation
commit SHA is recorded in the final session handoff and must remain the branch
tip. Draft PR creation is the only permitted external delivery action; the
branch remains unmerged and Jira remains read-only.

The capability records Supplier Returns from accepted Goods Receipt evidence
with linked Purchase Order/PO line, Supplier Confirmation where present,
Goods Receipt/receipt line, Supplier, Warehouse, Product/UOM, quantity,
reason/condition, commercial outcome, private evidence-reference, and
Tenant/Company/Branch snapshots. Server-derived eligibility is accepted
receipt quantity less active non-reversed Supplier Return quantity. Rejected
receipt quantity is never eligible and the MESP-125 damaged quantity remains a
non-additive condition overlay. Source version touching and optimistic
concurrency prevent overlapping returns from consuming the same remainder.

The lifecycle is Draft -> Submitted -> Approved -> AwaitingInventory ->
AwaitingFinance -> Completed, with truthful Rejected/Cancelled/Reversed and
forward-linked CorrectionLinked successor records. Inventory handoff and
Finance correction/credit references are Procurement evidence only: no stock
ledger, on-hand, Inventory valuation, AP, GL, tax posting, payment, supplier
balance, or authoritative downstream posting is created. Posted/source facts
remain immutable; corrections and reversals preserve original evidence,
actor, reason, timestamp, authorization, correlation, idempotency, history,
and audit.

REST/OpenAPI/Foundation metadata, antiforgery, ETags/If-Match, durable
idempotency replay/conflict handling, Tenant-safe EF persistence, the additive
`20260821031935_MESP127SupplierReturnEvidence` migration, operational reporting
rows/metrics, and a bilingual responsive Angular workspace are included.
Validation is Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; backend 844/844 with 0
skipped including the disposable LocalDB safety harness; focused Supplier
Return architecture tests 3/3; Angular 239/239 across 31 spec files;
production bundle 494.71 kB initial with 57.40 kB Supplier Return lazy chunk;
focused Supplier Return Chromium 2/2; full Chromium 24/24; both npm audits 0
vulnerabilities; `git diff --check` clean. `frontend/assets` is untouched.

No Jira writes were performed. No MESP-128, Inventory, Finance/AP, payment,
external integration, statutory/ZATCA/FATOORA, DNS/TLS, or Wafra-specific core
behavior was started. The next exact session is Sol acceptance of this branch
and Draft PR; do not merge or begin MESP-128 from this handoff.

## Current authoritative position - 21 August 2026 (MESP-126 Opus P1 remediation complete; delta review handoff)

MESP-126 P1 remediation is committed at
`d2a107e427df335a0067c77c30d07562608ab743` on
`feat/MESP-126-three-way-matching-tolerances`, continuing Draft PR #70 against
`main`. The public `PurchaseInvoiceExchangeRateReferenceRequest` now accepts
only `ExchangeRateId`; the MESP-120 provider derives the effective version
from immutable supplier invoice-date evidence and uses only the existing
immutable handoff date field as its fallback. A missing date fails closed.
Provider, service, DTO-shape, snapshot, and missing-date tests cover the
authority boundary.

Supplier-declared lines are quantity-aggregated by `PurchaseOrderLineId` so
each PO line gets one quantity variance. Declared allocations are aggregated by
`GoodsReceiptLineId` and compared against the handoff-supported and active
AcceptedQuantity bound; duplicate supplier evidence is preserved and
classified rather than rejected or double-consumed. Individual price, tax,
discount, line amount, and header total comparisons remain in place. Exact
Tenant/Company/Branch scope remains server-derived and explicit; no
Company-to-Branch policy inheritance was invented.

The Angular matching detail now provides an accessible EN/AR RTL
human-readable Exchange Rate selector only for active pair-compatible
identities with a valid immutable invoice-date version. The browser sends only
the selected identity and displays the applied server-owned rate/version/date/
provenance snapshot; no raw GUID or editable rate/scale/version/effective-date
input is exposed. Same-currency evaluation remains reference-free, and missing
cross-currency choices remain fail-closed. Focused and full Playwright cover
the selector and payload behavior.

Validation after this remediation: Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused
handoff/matching remediation 37/37; full backend 841/841 passed, 0 skipped,
including 22 disposable LocalDB SQL safety cases with zero orphan databases;
Angular 238/238 across 31 spec files; production bundle 494.00 kB initial with
38.05 kB matching lazy chunk; focused matching Chromium 3/3 and full Chromium
22/22; production-only and full npm audits 0 vulnerabilities; `git diff --check`
clean. Headline production percentages remain ~44% overall and ~39%
Procurement/P2P because this session is correctness remediation and UX
completion, not additive business scope. No Jira writes were performed. Draft
PR #70 remains open, Draft, and unmerged. Independent Claude Opus 5
read-only delta re-review is the next exact session; no MESP-127/AP/GL/payment/
stock/FX override or merge is authorized.

## Current authoritative position - 20 August 2026 (MESP-126 SOL acceptance remediation complete; independent review handoff)

MESP-125 (Goods Receipt and Purchase Invoice Handoff) is **Done** and
squash-merged to `main` by PR #69 at merge SHA
`42e51b673de5d076b56426180d914f7e3d07c54c`. The synchronized main baseline
passed the Release build with 0 warnings and 0 errors before MESP-126 began.

MESP-126 (Three-Way Matching, Tolerances, and Authorized Exception Resolution)
is **activated / implementation-complete at bounded scope** under Epic MESP-7
on `feat/MESP-126-three-way-matching-tolerances`. It adds independent
supplier-declared invoice evidence beside the preserved MESP-125 PO-derived
handoff preview; accepted Goods Receipt allocations; deterministic exact-safe
and runtime-configured tolerance evaluation against the current partial handoff;
truthful over/under supplier quantity evidence with cumulative accepted/confirmed
source limits; currency/tax evidence comparison with server-authoritative
MESP-120 Exchange Rate references; durable source snapshots, fingerprints,
history, audit, and replay; authorized reasoned exception resolution with
configuration-led resolution/SoD policy evidence; optimistic concurrency;
REST/OpenAPI registration; EF Core migrations; and a bilingual EN/AR RTL
matching workspace.

Legacy handoffs without independent evidence remain readable and explicitly
evaluate as not match-ready. Procurement remains the source/evidence owner;
Finance owns AP, GL, tax accounting, posting, reconciliation, and payment.
There is no stock/on-hand mutation, Inventory valuation, external FX or invoice
integration, supplier portal, statutory/ZATCA/FATOORA behavior, or Wafra-specific
core behavior.

Validation: Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused handoff/matching
regression tests 30/30; canonical full backend runner 834/834 passed with all
22 SQL safety cases executed against a disposable LocalDB database; Angular
235/235 across 30 spec files; production bundle 494.00 kB initial with a
29.75 kB matching lazy chunk; focused matching Playwright 2/2 and full
Chromium Playwright 21/21; production-only and full npm audits report 0
vulnerabilities; EF migration listing includes the MESP-126 evidence and
resolution-policy migrations. No Jira writes were performed. Independent
read-only Claude Opus 5 review remains required before merge, and Draft PR #70
must remain unmerged.

## Historical authoritative position - 19 August 2026 (MESP-125 implementation complete; pre-Opus handoff)

MESP-125 (Goods Receipt and Purchase Invoice Handoff) is **repository-complete on
branch `feat/MESP-125-goods-receipt-purchase-invoice-handoff`** and published as a
Draft PR against `main`. It completes the physical receiving, warehouse scoping,
damage tracking, and pro-rata Purchase Invoice handoff slice under Epic MESP-7.

### MESP-125 Delivered Capability

- **Goods Receipt Lifecycle & Receiving**:
  - Receipt creation strictly from eligible Confirmed Purchase Orders with server-enforced line matching.
  - Authorized warehouse selection and active validation via `IProcurementWarehouseProvider` (`ConfiguredProcurementWarehouseProvider` registered in API bootstrap). Unknown, cross-tenant, inactive, or scope-mismatched warehouses are rejected (`warehouse_not_authorized`, `warehouse_inactive`, `warehouse_scope_denied`).
  - Line receiving with strict physical partition and damage overlay semantics:
    - Physical partition invariant: `ReceivedQuantity = AcceptedQuantity + RejectedQuantity` (`ReceivedQuantity > 0`, `AcceptedQuantity >= 0`, `RejectedQuantity >= 0`).
    - Damaged condition overlay: `DamagedQuantity <= ReceivedQuantity` (independent descriptive condition/disposition overlay, non-additive, never double-counted; `Received != Accepted + Rejected + Damaged` and `Received != Accepted + Damaged`).
    - Line notes, damage notes, and rejection reasons.
  - Commercial remainder calculation: `RemainingReceivableQuantity = ConfirmedQuantity - sum(Active AcceptedQuantity)`. Rejected physical quantity does not satisfy the supplier's commercial obligation.
  - Over-receipt enforcement: total accepted quantity across all active receipts cannot exceed the PO line receivable quantity (`over_receipt_not_allowed`).
  - Receipt cancellation with mandatory reason. Cancellation is blocked if the receipt is referenced by an active Purchase Invoice Handoff (`goods_receipt_referenced_by_active_invoice_handoff`). When cancelled, accepted quantity is released back to the PO line remainder.
- **Purchase Invoice Handoff**:
  - Handoff creation from accepted Goods Receipt lines belonging to Confirmed Purchase Orders.
  - Pro-rata tax distribution and un-invoiced quantity remainder tracking (`RemainingHandoffQuantity = AcceptedQuantity - sum(Active HandedOffQuantity)`).
  - Supplier invoice reference, invoice date, and external document notes capture.
  - Handoff cancellation with mandatory reason, releasing referenced receipt lines for re-invoicing.
- **Architectural & Concurrency Governance**:
  - FIN-OD-01 / PD-046 strictly adhered to: Finance owns balanced journals, GL mapping, and posting; operational modules own source documents and do not fabricate accounting entries.
  - Concurrency safety: calling `.TouchVersion()` on source PO and Receipt entities prevents race conditions and over-receipt / over-invoicing across concurrent requests (`concurrency_conflict` / HTTP 409).
  - Durable idempotency replay probe pattern with versioned audit snapshots.
  - Tenant and Company/Branch authorization on every read and mutation endpoint.
- **Bilingual Angular Workspaces & Accessibility**:
  - Full Goods Receipt workspace at `/app/procurement/goods-receipts` (List, Create with PO source selector and warehouse picker, Detail with summary/lines/damage/history/audit tabs, Cancel dialog).
  - Full Purchase Invoice Handoff workspace at `/app/procurement/invoice-handoffs` (List, Create with receipt line selector and pro-rata tax preview, Detail with summary/lines/sources/history/audit tabs, Cancel dialog).
  - Bilingual English/Arabic support with RTL/LTR layout, ARIA tabs, keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and error classification.

### Validation Evidence

- **Release Build**: 0 warnings / 0 errors (`dotnet build backend\MiniErp.sln -c Release`).
- **Backend Tests**: **812 / 812 passed, 0 skipped** via `validate-foundation.ps1` and `Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1`, including the SQL Server LocalDB safety harness against disposable database `MiniErpFoundation_*` (cleanly removed with 0 orphan databases).
- **Angular Unit Tests**: **232 / 232 passed** across 29 spec files via `ng test --watch=false`.
- **Production Bundle**: **493.41 kB initial total** (118.91 kB transfer, under 500 kB budget), **53.14 kB Goods Receipt lazy chunk**, **53.41 kB Invoice Handoff lazy chunk**.
- **Playwright E2E**: **19 / 19 passed** across full Chromium suite, including end-to-end receipt creation, inspection, warehouse selection, invoice handoff, pro-rata tax calculation, cancellation, and bilingual switching.
- **Security**: `npm audit --omit=dev`: **0 vulnerabilities**; full `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities**.
- **Git diff**: Whitespace check clean.

### Domain Boundaries & Non-Scope Invariants

- **Inventory Boundary**: No stock ledger posting, warehouse bin movement, or inventory valuation journal was fabricated (reserved for inventory/accounting module integration).
- **Finance Boundary**: No general ledger journal entry, accounts payable invoice, payment record, or three-way matching completion was performed (reserved for Finance domain under FIN-OD-01).
- **Protected Assets**: Files under `frontend/assets` remain untouched.
- **Zero Jira Writes**: GPT-5.6 Sol owns Jira management; no Jira operations performed in this session.

### Next Exact Gate

- **Independent Claude Opus 5 pre-merge review** for MESP-125 per `TASK.md`. PR remains open, Draft, and unmerged.

## Historical authoritative position - 19 August 2026 (MESP-124 merged; post-merge reconciliation)

MESP-124 is **complete, independently reviewed by Claude Opus 5 (verdict:
APPROVE FOR MERGE), and squash-merged to `main`** at commit
`c742d9c897edb715c7e3c25df7e9ca2c4f30d1e6` (merge timestamp 2026-08-18T21:37:47Z;
reviewed feature head `0eca12dbecffe7e8abeff6914566fa4de329d2c7`; PR #68
merged). The repository `main` branch is synchronized with `origin/main`.
Jira closure is managed by GPT-5.6 Sol; zero Jira writes were performed in this
documentation and governance reconciliation session.

### MESP-124 Merged Capability

- **Source Lineage & Sourcing Prerequisite**: Purchase Orders are created
  exclusively from server-authorized approved Purchase Requests, submitted
  Supplier Quotations, and active Source Decisions.
- **PO Lifecycle & Management**: Full draft, edit, submit, approval, rejection,
  return-for-change, issue, and cancel workflows with optimistic concurrency
  (`If-Match` / ETag).
- **Approval Engine & Governance**: Multi-stage approval, configured delegation,
  and strict separation of duties (no self-approval).
- **Supplier Confirmation**: Manual confirmation capture supporting full,
  partial, rejected, and no-response outcomes, with exact confirmation remainder
  calculation across multiple lines.
- **Supplier Change Proposals & Controlled Reapproval**: Capture of supplier-proposed
  quantity, price, and delivery-date changes; multi-stage reapproval with stage
  approver reset; rejection retaining prior commitments; and safety validations
  preventing quantity reduction below already confirmed amounts.
- **Lifetime Source Decision Consumption**: Lifetime Tenant-scoped uniqueness
  `(TenantId, SourceDecisionId)` enforced via additive EF Core migration
  `20260818103736_PurchaseOrderCommercialIntegrityAndDurableReplay`. Cancelled
  or Rejected POs permanently consume the source decision; recovery requires a
  new sourcing decision. Controlled same-PO reopening is deferred as a future
  explicit capability/decision.
- **Durable Idempotency & Immutable Audit**: Versioned serialized snapshots
  stored in immutable audit records; safe replay probe executed after trusted
  Tenant and actor authorization but before state-dependent checks; 409 conflict
  on key reuse across differing payloads or targets.
- **Angular Frontend & Accessibility**: Complete English / Arabic (RTL/LTR)
  workspace with tab/panel ARIA semantics, focus trapping, keyboard navigation,
  dialog backdrop safety, and localized non-ISO currency fallback.
- **Module Persistence**: Dedicated SQL Server schema `procurement` with formal
  EF Core migrations.

### Accepted Validation Evidence at Merge

- **Release Build**: 0 warnings / 0 errors (`dotnet build backend\MiniErp.sln -c Release`).
- **Backend ArchitectureTests**: **793/793 passed, 0 skipped**, with the SQL Server
  safety harness genuinely executed against disposable LocalDB and dropped cleanly
  with zero orphan databases.
- **Focused Purchase Order Tests**: **14/14 passed**; focused PO + REST foundation
  tests: **47/47 passed**.
- **Angular Unit Tests**: **216/216 passed** across 25 spec files.
- **Production Build**: **492.02 kB initial bundle**, **76.78 kB PO lazy chunk**,
  **91.94 kB Supplier Quotation lazy chunk** (under the 500 kB budget).
- **Security & Vulnerabilities**: `npm audit --omit=dev`: **0 vulnerabilities**;
  full `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities** (transitive `nanoid` 3.3.18 lockfile patch).
- **Playwright E2E**: Focused Purchase Order Chromium **8/8 passed**; full Chromium
  **16/16 passed**.
- **Manual Interactive Browser**: NOT PERFORMED (automated Chromium evidence only).

### Domain Boundaries & Non-Scope Invariants

- **Procurement Scope Only**: No Goods Receipt, stock mutation, warehouse movement,
  Purchase Invoice, Accounts Payable (AP), payment, accounting posting, or three-way
  matching was implemented in MESP-124.
- **External & Infrastructure**: No supplier portal, external supplier integration,
  ZATCA/FATOORA, production DNS/TLS, or customer-specific (Wafra) branching was added.
- **Production Gates**: Formal migration is present; production/provider, MESP-48,
  MESP-50, backup/restore, capacity, legal, specialist, and cutover gates remain open.
- **Owner Assets**: Protected source assets under `frontend/assets` remain untouched.

### Non-Blocking P3 Observations Carried Forward

- **P3-1**: Approval stage empty `EligibleApproverIds` semantics are implicit/inherited from MESP-123.
- **P3-2**: Supplier-change rejection pending-change query has minor line-ID predicate asymmetry.
- **P3-3**: Some state/config errors still map to generic HTTP 400 rather than more precise HTTP 409 / 503 semantics.
- **P3-4**: Angular creates a new idempotency key per explicit user retry; durable replay is therefore mainly server/API retry protection.
- **P3-5**: `ReplayResponseSnapshotJson` duplicates commercial data in immutable audit and must feed retention/privacy/purge governance (MESP-50).
- **P3-6**: `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` should neutralize inherited `MESP_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` during tests.
- **P3-7**: Cancelled/Rejected PO permanently consumes the source decision in MESP-124; controlled reopen remains a future explicit capability/decision.
- **P3-8**: Transitive `nanoid` lockfile-only security patch is intentionally present.

### Next Capability & Decision Gates

- **Active Capability**: **MESP-125 — Goods Receipt and Purchase Invoice handoff** (Parent Epic: MESP-7).
- **Current Status**: **IN PROGRESS / ACTIVATED** (Jira activation comment `11503`).
- **Immediate Implementation Executor**: Claude Sonnet 5 (Reasoning: HIGH) on branch `feat/MESP-125-goods-receipt-purchase-invoice-handoff` per root `TASK.md`.
- **Prerequisite Gate Status**:
  - MESP-41 (Procurement approval policy): **Done**
  - MESP-43 (Supplier quote evaluation): **Done**
  - MESP-44 (Purchase order lifecycle & confirmation): **Done**
  - MESP-45 (Goods receipt physical & tolerance baseline): **Done**
  - MESP-113 (INV-OD-004 inventory valuation method): **Done**
  - MESP-116 (Release 1 Consolidated Owner Decision Approval): **Done** (Owner approval comment `10957`)
  - **FIN-OD-01 / PD-046** (Goods Receipt interim accounting, clearing/accrual, valuation/posting treatment):
    **APPROVED CONTRACT-BOUND** under MESP-116 (comment `10957`) and PD-046 (`docs/31_Release_1_Consolidated_Owner_Decision_Pack.md` §B6 / MESP-22 comment `10958`). Class-B Release 1 product/implementation contract is established: Finance owns balanced journals, source-to-GL mapping, account and period validation, subledger reconciliation, inventory valuation handoff, controlled corrections and reversals, and auditable posting evidence; operational modules own source documents and do not fabricate accounting entries outside the approved Finance contract. Production/statutory/specialist validation remains a later open gate and does not block safe bounded application development.
- **Implementation Status**: MESP-125 is **ACTIVATED and IMPLEMENTATION-READY** for execution by Claude Sonnet 5 per `TASK.md`.

## Historical authoritative position - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 final Opus P2 remediation)

The bounded MESP-124 final P2 remediation pass is implemented on
`feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation`, continuing Draft PR #68 against
`main`. Jira remained read-only; MESP-124 is still In Progress with activation
evidence `11394`. MESP-143 remains the merged ADR-019 prerequisite at
`866cb75bb7d0d97c929216b1a449f458a2614097`.

### Remediation delivered

- Supplier confirmation writes now persist confirmation facts even when the
  same response proposes price/date/quantity changes. Approved and rejected
  supplier changes recompute ordered, confirmed, remaining, latest response,
  and resulting status from durable state. Proposed quantity reductions below
  already confirmed quantity fail before mutation with
  `proposed_quantity_below_confirmed`.
- A source decision is consumed for the lifetime of its Tenant by the new
  additive unique index `(TenantId, SourceDecisionId)` and migration
  `20260818103736_PurchaseOrderCommercialIntegrityAndDurableReplay`. Existing
  migrations `20260817143432_PurchaseOrderAndSupplierConfirmation` and
  `20260817211222_AddPurchaseOrderAuditRequestFingerprint` were not rewritten.
  Source options hide consumed decisions, create is server-authoritative, and
  unique races map to `purchase_order_duplicate` / HTTP 409.
- Successful create/edit/lifecycle/confirmation/supplier-change responses are
  persisted as version-1 serialized `PurchaseOrderRecord` snapshots on the
  immutable audit row. Replays return the original snapshot selected by the
  original successful occurrence, after current target/resource authorization
  and before state-dependent checks; raw requests are not stored as replay
  payloads. Same-key fingerprint/target conflicts remain HTTP 409 and replay
  has no duplicate effects.
- Purchase Order HTTP mapping now classifies creator/self/ineligible approval
  denial as HTTP 403 and approval duplication, source duplication, impossible
  quantity, and idempotency conflicts as HTTP 409. REST fingerprints now bind
  edit/confirmation/lifecycle cache entries to their target PO as well as
  request/version. ISO currency rendering has explicit two-decimal bounds
  while non-ISO fallback preserves the raw code.
- Angular PO tables use column scopes; tabs have stable tab/panel IDs and ARIA
  relationships with keyboard navigation, including rendered inactive-panel
  anchors; action dialogs have entry focus, Tab/Shift+Tab trapping, Escape
  close, backdrop safety, and opener restoration.
- The frontend lockfile now resolves the patched transitive `nanoid` 3.3.18
  release; both production-only and full `npm audit` are clean.
- Supplier-change reapproval now resets completed-stage approver IDs and count
  before entering the next stage, while incomplete stages retain their current
  approvers. A direct two-stage load-bearing test proves A/B complete Stage A,
  C alone cannot complete Stage B, and D completes the genuine Stage B change;
  history records `stage-a`, `stage-a`, `stage-b`, and the final `stage-b`
  approval action without treating A as a Stage-B duplicate.
- Direct supplier-change reapproval coverage now proves eligible and
  ineligible actors, self-approval denial, valid delegation, invalid/expired
  delegation, and wrong-actor delegation failure through the existing
  approval/delegation engine.
- A real duplicate-source behavior test creates one PO and proves a second
  create from the same Tenant + Source Decision returns
  `purchase_order_duplicate` with one PO, history aggregate, and audit
  aggregate. The lifetime source-consumption rule remains unchanged.
- Cancelled/Rejected PO detail now states in EN/AR that the source decision is
  consumed and recovery requires a new sourcing decision. Controlled same-PO
  reopen/replacement semantics remain explicitly future capability/decision;
  no source reuse or reopen workflow was implemented. Durable replay-header
  work is deferred as P3 because it would require a public result-contract
  redesign.

### Validation evidence

- Release backend solution build: 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Full backend ArchitectureTests: **793/793 passed, 0 skipped**, including all
  SQL Server safety cases against a disposable LocalDB target. Focused PO
  tests: **14/14**; focused PO + REST foundation tests: **47/47**.
- Angular unit tests: **216/216** across 25 spec files. Production build:
  **492.02 kB initial**, **76.78 kB Purchase Order lazy**, **91.94 kB Supplier
  Quotation lazy**. Both production-only and full `npm audit` report 0
  vulnerabilities.
- Playwright runtime validation is complete: focused Purchase Order Chromium
  E2E **8/8** and full Chromium E2E **16/16** passed. The official Development
  configuration smoke passed; live API `/health` and module-registration
  returned HTTP 200, the Angular root and PO route returned HTTP 200, and the
  repository-owned listeners remain live for handoff on API 5300 / Angular
  4300. The unauthenticated API PO list correctly retained its 401 boundary. No
  production-capability percentage increase is claimed for this remediation.

### Next exact gate

The next session is an independent Claude Opus 5 read-only MESP-124 pre-merge
review. It must explicitly verify the P1-A/P1-B commercial and uniqueness
invariants, multi-stage supplier-change stage reset and genuine two-stage
coverage, supplier-change delegation/self-approval cases, all exact durable
replay-after-mutation cases including cache expiry/process restart,
authorization-before-replay ordering, 403/409 HTTP semantics, terminal
new-source recovery wording, controlled reopen deferral, PO keyboard/focus
accessibility, additive migration integrity, and complete regression evidence.

## Historical authoritative position - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 durable idempotency ordering correction)

GPT-5.6 Sol confirmed F-1 closed and accepted the F-2 SHA-256 request
fingerprint design and the persistence-side same-key/different-request
conflict detection, but raised one remaining F-2 **completeness** finding.
Claude Sonnet 5 performed one further bounded corrective session, sole
executor, on `feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation` (Draft PR #68) to
close it without redesigning the accepted parts and without expanding scope.

### The defect: ordering, not fingerprinting

Several `PurchaseOrderService` commands performed lifecycle-state,
optimistic-concurrency, approval-stage, approval-policy, delegation,
supplier-change, and reapproval-policy checks *before* persisted idempotency
evidence could be consulted. An identical retry therefore stopped being
replayable as soon as the original success advanced state — and permanently
so once the volatile ten-minute `LocalMasterDataIdempotencyStore` REST cache
expired or the API process restarted. The affected commands returned
`submit_not_allowed` once the order reached `PendingApproval`,
`decision_not_allowed` once `Approved`, `issue_not_allowed` once `Issued`,
`confirmation_not_allowed` for a Rejected confirmation once the order was
`Rejected` or for a confirmation that had itself created
`ChangedPendingApproval`, and `supplier_change_approval_not_allowed` once the
order left `ChangedPendingApproval`.

### The correction

- A bounded read-only durable replay probe is exposed as
  `IPurchaseOrderPersistence.ProbeReplayAsync(TenantContext, PurchaseOrderReplayQuery)`
  returning `PurchaseOrderReplayProbe` with outcome NotFound / Replay /
  Conflict. It reuses the already-stored Tenant-scoped audit evidence
  (Tenant filter, ActorId, OperationId, Idempotency-Key, PurchaseOrderId where
  applicable, RequestFingerprint) and does not duplicate the mutation engine.
- `PurchaseOrderPersistence.FindReplayAsync` was refactored into a shared
  query-based core plus an evidence-shaped wrapper, so the probe and the
  in-transaction check resolve replay identically. Create is discriminated by
  a null target rather than by a magic string, preserving prior behavior.
- `PurchaseOrderService` calls the probe in the correct position on create,
  edit, submit, cancel, issue, confirmation capture, approve/reject/
  return-for-change, and supplier-change approve/reject.
- **No schema change was introduced** and the accepted additive migration
  `20260817211222_AddPurchaseOrderAuditRequestFingerprint` was not rewritten.
  The probe query is covered by the existing
  `(TenantId, ActorId, OperationId, IdempotencyKey)` index.

### Security ordering (replay is not an authorization bypass)

For an existing Purchase Order the probe runs only **after** the trusted
Tenant context is established, the current target is resolved and proven to
belong to that Tenant, and the current actor is authorized for that resource
and operation (`GetAuthorizedAsync`). It runs **before** lifecycle-state
requirements, current optimistic-concurrency comparison, approval-stage
state, approval-policy re-resolution, delegation resolution, supplier-change
current-state validation, and reapproval-policy re-resolution. Because replay
is matched on the exact `ActorId`, separation of duties cannot be bypassed: a
creator attempting self-approval can never match another actor's evidence. If
current authorization has genuinely been revoked, the pre-probe authorization
check fails first and idempotency does not reveal the old resource.

Create has no pre-existing target, so an identical create retry is authorized
against the scope of the Purchase Order the original request actually created
before it is returned. A genuinely new create still runs full current
source-decision validation and fails closed. A probe failure returns NotFound
and falls through to the normal path, and the in-transaction persistence-side
replay check inside `MutateAsync` / `RecordConfirmationAsync` / `CreateAsync`
was retained as defense in depth.

### Regression coverage

Four new tests in
`backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/PurchaseOrderTests.cs` exercise
`PurchaseOrderService` plus real persistence and bypass the REST in-memory
replay cache entirely:

- `Replays_durable_submit_approve_and_issue_after_the_original_request_advanced_state`
- `Replays_durable_confirmation_and_supplier_change_approval_after_the_order_left_the_eligible_state`
  (covers both the confirmation that created `ChangedPendingApproval` and the
  Rejected confirmation after the order became `Rejected`)
- `Replays_durable_supplier_change_rejection_after_the_order_left_changed_pending_approval`
- `Replays_durable_create_after_source_state_drift_without_weakening_new_create_validation`

Each asserts the original version/result is returned, and that there is no
duplicate history entry, no duplicate audit success entry, no duplicate
confirmation, no duplicate supplier change, and no second mutation. Existing
conflict coverage (same key + different fingerprint, same key + different
target, conflict leaves the target unchanged) and the existing identical Edit
replay remain green and unmodified.

The four new tests were verified to be load-bearing rather than tautological:
against the pre-correction `PurchaseOrderService` they fail 4/4 while the four
pre-existing Purchase Order tests still pass.

### Validation (this correction session)

- Release solution build: **0 warnings / 0 errors**.
- Official `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1`: **778/778 passed, 0 skipped**
  (up from 774; +4 new durable-replay regression tests) against disposable
  LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_20260818103729_8fb927af`. The SQL safety harness
  genuinely executed against real LocalDB; the runner cleaned its target and
  **zero orphan `MiniErpFoundation_*` databases** remain; the persistent
  `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` was unchanged and the persistent `MESP`
  database is intact and was never the safety target.
- Targeted `PurchaseOrderTests`/`RestFoundationTests` filter: **41/41 passed**
  (up from 37).
- Backend-only correction: **no frontend source, dependency, or asset file was
  touched**, so the Angular unit, production build, and Playwright suites were
  not rerun. Their last recorded evidence (212/212 Angular across 25 spec
  files; 492.02 kB initial / 72.94 kB Purchase Order lazy / 91.94 kB Supplier
  Quotation lazy; Chromium 15/15) stands unchanged.
- `npm audit`: unchanged at **1 high** (`nanoid` transitive advisory,
  GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8). `frontend/package.json` and
  `frontend/package-lock.json` were not touched, `npm audit fix` was not run,
  and the advisory remains a separate pre-production Owner/Sol
  dependency-security follow-up rather than part of this correction.
- `git status --short -- frontend/assets`: clean; Owner-managed assets
  untouched.

This is correction work, not new business scope: no production-capability
percentage increase is claimed. Draft PR #68 remains **OPEN, DRAFT, and
UNMERGED**; no force-push occurred. Zero Jira operations were performed
(GPT-5.6 Sol owns Jira). The next exact session remains independent **Claude
Opus 5 MESP-124 pre-merge review**, using the updated `TASK.md`, which now
also requires explicit verification of durable replay after cache expiry and
process restart, the six state-advanced replay scenarios, the
`ChangedPendingApproval` confirmation replay, the absence of duplicate
history/audit/evidence, and the unchanged 409 conflict semantics. Do not merge
this branch and do not start MESP-125.

## Historical authoritative position - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 pre-Opus Sol findings correction; superseded by the durable idempotency ordering correction)

Before independent Opus review, GPT-5.6 Sol raised two findings against the
completed MESP-124 implementation on branch
`feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation`, Draft PR #68. Claude Sonnet 5
performed one bounded corrective session, sole executor, that resolved both
without expanding scope:

- **F-1 (Currency Rendering Resilience)**: `formatMoney` in
  `frontend/src/app/features/procurement/purchase-order-workspace.component.ts`
  now reuses the proven MESP-123 Supplier Quotation safety pattern — a
  try/catch around ISO currency-styled `Intl.NumberFormat`, falling back to a
  localized 2-decimal render suffixed with the raw currency code (e.g.
  `1,234.56 S2K`) — preserving the PO-specific `currencyDisplay: 'code'` UX.
  Zero FX/currency substitution/hidden-amount effect. New focused coverage in
  `purchase-order-workspace.component.spec.ts` (direct `formatMoney` safety
  test plus a non-ISO-currency list-rendering test), modeled on the MESP-123
  spec.
- **F-2 (Idempotency Replay/Conflict Fidelity)**:
  `PurchaseOrderPersistence.FindReplayAsync` previously matched only Tenant +
  ActorId + OperationId + IdempotencyKey and returned whichever PO that
  combination last touched. A deterministic server-side SHA-256 request
  fingerprint is now threaded from the REST endpoint layer through
  `PurchaseOrderService` into persistence, with a 3-way `ReplayLookup`
  (NotFound / Replay / Conflict) applied to every unsafe MESP-124 command.
  Identical retries deterministically replay; a reused key against a
  different payload or a different target now returns HTTP 409
  `idempotency_conflict` rather than ever silently replaying an unrelated
  result. Delivered as an additive EF Core migration
  (`20260817211222_AddPurchaseOrderAuditRequestFingerprint`) adding
  `PurchaseOrderAudit.RequestFingerprint`; no applied migration was rewritten.
  New regression test
  `Distinguishes_identical_retry_replay_from_cross_target_and_same_target_fingerprint_conflicts`
  in `PurchaseOrderTests.cs` exercises replay, same-target conflict, and
  cross-target conflict, with an explicit zero-mutation assertion.

Tenant scoping of replay lookup is preserved transparently by the existing
`ProcurementDbContext` Tenant query filter; no cross-Tenant replay path was
introduced or altered.

### Validation (this correction session)

- Release solution build: **0 warnings / 0 errors**.
- Official `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1`: **774/774 passed, 0 skipped**
  against disposable LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_20260818002533_bd5e030f`; the
  persistent `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` was unchanged and the safety
  target was cleaned by the runner.
- Targeted `PurchaseOrderTests`/`RestFoundationTests` filter: **37/37 passed**.
- Angular: **212/212 across 25 spec files** (new
  `purchase-order-workspace.component.spec.ts`).
- Production build: **492.02 kB initial**, **72.94 kB Purchase Order lazy
  chunk**, **91.94 kB Supplier Quotation lazy chunk** (unchanged), no budget
  increase.
- Chromium Playwright: **15/15**, full existing suite including all seven
  MESP-124 scenarios, unchanged.
- `npm audit`: **1 high** (`nanoid` transitive advisory, GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8).
  Confirmed pre-existing and unrelated: `frontend/package.json` and
  `frontend/package-lock.json` were not touched by this session or by
  MESP-124; the advisory reflects a newly published upstream disclosure
  against an already-installed transitive dependency, not a regression
  introduced here. Left unresolved for a separate Owner-authorized dependency
  update decision rather than silently patched inside this bounded
  correction.
- `git status --short -- frontend/assets`: clean; Owner-managed assets
  untouched.

Draft PR #68 remains **OPEN, DRAFT, and UNMERGED**; no force-push occurred.
Zero Jira operations were performed (GPT-5.6 Sol owns Jira). The next exact
session remains independent **Claude Opus 5 MESP-124 pre-merge review**,
using the updated `TASK.md`, which now requires explicit re-verification of
F-1 and F-2. Do not merge this branch and do not start MESP-125.

## Historical authoritative position - 17 August 2026 (MESP-124 implementation; pre-merge handoff; superseded by pre-Opus Sol findings correction)

MESP-143 (Tenant-Aware Entry Routing and Operational Workspace Context) is
**implemented, independently reviewed by Claude Opus 5, and squash-merged to `main`**
at commit `866cb75bb7d0d97c929216b1a449f458a2614097` (reviewed feature head:
`25b5ce5008aee3e15787f2dbd89649551786bb64`; PR #67 merged by the Owner).

MESP-124 is implemented on branch `feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation`
from that synchronized baseline and published as **Draft PR #68** against
`main`. Jira was read-only verified as MESP-124 In
Progress with activation evidence comment `11394`; MESP-143 closure evidence is
comment `11393`. No Jira write was performed.

### Bounded capability delivered

- Tenant- and server-authorized Company/Branch-scoped Purchase Order list,
  source selection, create, edit, detail, submit, approval, issue, rejection,
  return-for-change, and cancellation paths.
- Server revalidation of the approved Purchase Request, submitted Supplier
  Quotation, current Source Decision, supplier, currency, scope, and selected
  lines, with immutable source/commercial snapshots on the PO.
- Reuse of the existing approval policy, SoD, delegation, exact-version
  concurrency, idempotency, immutable lifecycle history, audit, and evidence
  seams; no second approval engine.
- Manual Supplier Confirmation with full, exact per-line partial, rejection,
  no-response, evidence references, and supplier-proposed quantity/price/date
  changes. Material changes return to controlled reapproval and retain prior,
  proposed, accepted/current, actor, timestamp, reason, and decision evidence.
- Formal Procurement EF Core migration for the PO/confirmation/history/audit/
  supplier-change tables, registered Tenant ownership verification, Foundation
  operation metadata/OpenAPI documentation, and bilingual Angular workspace.

### Architecture and security outcome

1. **Tenant != Workspace** remains enforced by the MESP-143 server context; PO
   endpoints do not accept client Tenant authority or raw context selection.
2. **Source lineage is server-owned**: the Angular client selects a business
   source option, while the server validates the approved PR/quotation/decision,
   supplier/currency, scope, and line set before persistence.
3. **Company/Branch scope and Tenant ownership** are applied to every PO,
   confirmation, evidence, history, audit, and supplier-change read/write path.
4. **No downstream effect**: issue and supplier confirmation record commercial
   evidence only; no stock, receipt, invoice, AP, payment, accounting, or
   three-way matching behavior is present.
5. **Owner assets** under `frontend/assets` are untouched; no Wafra-specific
   branch or schema behavior was introduced.

### Validation and next exact session

- Release solution build: **0 warnings / 0 errors**.
- Official `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1`: **773/773 passed, 0 skipped**
  against disposable LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_20260817183503_0e07d663`;
  the persistent `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` was unchanged and the
  safety target was cleaned by the runner.
- Angular: **210/210 across 24 spec files**.
- Production build: **492.02 kB initial**, **72.78 kB Purchase Order lazy
  chunk**, **91.94 kB Supplier Quotation lazy chunk**, with no budget increase.
- Chromium Playwright: **15/15** across the existing shell/quotation suites
  and seven deterministic MESP-124 scenarios.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: **0 vulnerabilities**.

Manual interactive browser review was not performed; Chromium Playwright and
automated API/service/SQL safety evidence are reported separately.
Production/provider migration governance, MESP-48/MESP-50, backup/restore,
capacity, legal, specialist, and cutover gates remain open. The next exact
session is independent **Claude Opus 5 MESP-124 pre-merge review**. Do not
merge this branch and do not start MESP-125.

## Historical authoritative position - 17 August 2026 (MESP-143 merged; post-merge repository reconciliation)

MESP-143 (Tenant-Aware Entry Routing and Operational Workspace Context) is
**implemented, independently reviewed by Claude Opus 5, and squash-merged to `main`**
at commit `866cb75bb7d0d97c929216b1a449f458a2614097` (reviewed feature head:

This session performs repository-state and governance reconciliation; zero
product, test, migration, or schema code was changed.

### Review Verdict and Validation Evidence

- **Independent Reviewer**: Claude Opus 5
- **Verdict**: `APPROVE FOR MERGE`
- **Findings**: P0: **0**, P1: **0**, P2: **0**, P3: **4 non-blocking observations**
- **Release solution build**: **0 warnings / 0 errors**
- **Backend test suite**: **770/770 passed, 0 skipped** (all 22 SQL Server safety-harness
  tests genuinely executed and passed against disposable LocalDB database
  `MiniErpFoundation_20260817144819_f27b32f1`, confirmed cleanly dropped with 0
  orphan databases remaining afterward); `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`
  confirmed unmodified throughout.
- **Frontend test suite**: Angular **204/204 passed across 23 spec files**
- **Production build**: **490.85 kB initial total** (119.53 kB transfer), **91.94 kB
  lazy quotation chunk** (15.73 kB transfer), within the 500 kB budget
- **Playwright E2E**: **8/8 passed across 2 spec files**
- **`npm audit --omit=dev`**: **0 vulnerabilities**
- **Live HTTP/API adversarial review**: PERFORMED (host routing, proxy forwarding,
  context switching, concurrency, branding fallback, SAR presentation)
- **Manual interactive browser**: NOT PERFORMED (automated Playwright and live HTTP evidence only)

### Accepted Architecture & Security Outcome

1. **Tenant != Workspace**: Tenant is the server-authorized isolation boundary. Host
   resolution yields candidate Tenant only (`Host + Auth + Membership = TenantContext`).
   Operational context is inside the Tenant and aligns with approved Company/Branch scope.
2. **Entry Flow**: Tenant host routes to exact authorized membership (fails closed on
   unknown/unauthorized); common host (`localhost`) presents bounded chooser of active
   memberships only with canonical routing; platform-admin host (`admin.localhost`) is
   a separate control plane with zero Tenant ERP authority.
3. **Security Defenses**: Untrusted forwarded-host spoofing rejected (`MESP_TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS`
   enforced); client Tenant header override rejected; context switches protected with
   antiforgery, audit, and optimistic concurrency.
4. **UX & Branding**: Overview is the initial authenticated landing surface; singular
   context auto-selects; multiple contexts use the header switcher; generic Tenant branding
   falls back to MESP (no `if tenant == Wafra` branch); SAR presentation asset has zero
   FX, tax, accounting, or persisted amount effect.
5. **Regressions & Scope**: Zero MESP-123 procurement regression; zero Tenant schema/migration
   introduced; Owner assets under `frontend/assets` remain untouched.

### Four Accepted Opus P3 Follow-Ups Carried Forward

- **P3-1 (Cross-host session continuity)**: Existing auth uses `__Host-` cookie. Future
  topology (`mesp.com` → `wafra.mesp.com`) requires re-authentication unless a deliberate
  cross-host SSO architecture is introduced. Mandatory design item before production
  multi-host cutover (currently UNDECIDED / FUTURE DESIGN).
- **P3-2 (Duplicate active membership invariant)**: Tenant preparation uses `SingleOrDefault`
  assuming at most one active membership per user + Tenant. Future hardening: enforce/test
  invariant explicitly or handle duplicate membership fail-closed without 500.
- **P3-3 (OpenAPI operation summary quality)**: `auth.operational-context-switch` summary
  falls back to generic "Use Auth" (matching existing `auth.context-switch`). Future polish:
  provide explicit descriptive summaries.
- **P3-4 (Canonical-host ambiguity)**: `GetCanonicalHost` chooses the first match if a
  Tenant has multiple bindings declaring different canonical hosts. Future hardening:
  enforce single canonical host per Tenant at startup.

### Terra HIGH Specialist Recommendation

- **GPT-5.6 Terra HIGH specialist security audit**: RECOMMENDED BEFORE PRODUCTION
  HOST/TLS/PROXY CUTOVER (not required now, not required for MESP-143 closure).
- Scope when activated: reverse-proxy chain, trusted proxy config, Forwarded headers,
  production DNS/TLS topology, cross-host auth/SSO, canonical-host constraints, host-header
  abuse, cache/session isolation.

## Historical authoritative position - 17 August 2026 (MESP-143 pre-Opus validation reconciliation)

The MESP-143 implementation on branch `feat/MESP-143-tenant-aware-entry`,
Draft PR #67 against `main`, is unchanged from its implementation head
`0fec629f330b8f73bbc329b579fc446280538729`. This session is validation and
governance reconciliation only; zero product, test, migration, or schema code
changed.

The prior handoff reported the backend suite as 748/770 with 22 SQL safety
tests environment-gated because the dedicated LocalDB safety connection was
not genuinely exercised. This session re-ran the release build and the full
backend suite through the approved safe entry point
`scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1`, which builds a disposable
`MiniErpFoundation_*` LocalDB target in process memory, assigns it only to
`MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING`, and leaves the persistent
`MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` runtime variable untouched throughout.

Corrected validation baseline: Release build **0 warnings / 0 errors**;
backend suite **770/770 passed, 0 skipped** (all 22 SQL Server safety-harness
tests genuinely executed and passed against disposable database
`MiniErpFoundation_20260817131747_f553ce07`, confirmed dropped with 0 orphan
`MiniErpFoundation_*` databases remaining afterward); `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`
confirmed unmodified and the persistent `MESP` database was never a safety
harness target. Frontend was rerun in full: Angular **204/204** across 23
spec files; production build **490.85 kB** initial with a **91.94 kB**
Supplier Quotation lazy chunk; Playwright **8/8**; `npm audit --omit=dev`
**0 vulnerabilities** — all matching the implementation-head baseline.

`TASK.md` is corrected so the next Claude Opus 5 MESP-143 review uses
`scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` as the sole accepted backend entry point and
no longer accepts environment-gated SQL safety tests as a green
`APPROVE FOR MERGE` outcome; genuine LocalDB unavailability must instead
return `BLOCKED` or `CHANGES REQUIRED / ENVIRONMENT BLOCKED`.

Draft PR #67 remains open, Draft, and unmerged. No Jira operation was
performed (GPT-5.6 Sol owns Jira). The next exact session remains independent
Claude Opus 5 targeted review of MESP-143 per the corrected `TASK.md`.

## Historical authoritative position - 17 August 2026 (MESP-143 implementation)

MESP-143 is implemented on branch `feat/MESP-143-tenant-aware-entry` from the
synchronized `main` baseline. The source capability is intentionally bounded:

- `TenantHostRegistry` normalizes configured host bindings, rejects malformed or
  colliding identities, and resolves common, Tenant-specific, platform-admin,
  or safe no-access entry modes. ASP.NET forwarded host/proto values are used
  only when configured proxy IPs are trusted; client Tenant headers are not an
  input.
- `TenantEntryAuthority` combines the host candidate with the authenticated
  server-side identity host. Tenant hosts select only the exact authorized
  membership; common hosts return only active ordinary memberships and support
  canonical-host routing; platform-admin hosts expose no Tenant ERP choices.
- The first-party REST contract exposes `auth.entry.read`, operational-context
  read/switch, generic branding, and SAR presentation metadata. Company/Branch
  contexts are derived through the existing organization-scope authorization
  seam and are automatically selected when singular or switched through the
  header when multiple.
- Angular lands authenticated users on Tenant Overview, keeps `/app/workspaces`
  only as a compatibility/management surface, removes workspace selection from
  primary navigation, and consumes server-resolved branding/currency data. The
  reusable currency presentation service never converts, mutates, or persists
  monetary values and preserves semantic currency-code fallbacks.
- The Development launcher preserves the browser Host through its proxy and
  supports `localhost`, `*.localhost`, and `admin.localhost` entry testing.
  `MESP_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` remains exact-Development, loopback-only, explicit,
  server-actor based, and disabled by default.

Owner-managed source assets under `frontend/assets` were inventoried and were
not changed; no concrete Wafra or Saudi Riyal source asset was regenerated or
fabricated by this session. No Tenant schema/migration, DNS/TLS automation,
external integration, Jira operation, Purchase Order, receipt, invoice,
payment, stock, or accounting behavior was added.

Validation at handoff: Angular unit tests are 204/204 across 23 spec files;
the production Angular build passes at 490.85 kB initial with a 91.94 kB
Supplier Quotation lazy chunk; 16 focused MESP-143 host/configuration/security
tests pass; the full backend suite is 748/770 with exactly 22 SQL safety cases
environment-gated by the absent dedicated LocalDB connection; Playwright is
8/8; and `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 0 vulnerabilities. The untrusted-
forwarded-host and exact Tenant-host integration regressions pass. The SQL
safety harness remains environment-gated when its dedicated LocalDB connection
variable is absent.

The next exact session is independent targeted Opus review of MESP-143 host and
Tenant isolation, platform boundary, operational-context concurrency,
branding/SAR fallback, and MESP-123 regression evidence. The Draft PR for this
branch must remain open, Draft, and unmerged; Jira remains owned by GPT-5.6 Sol.

## Historical authoritative position - 17 August 2026 (MESP-123 Opus findings correction & ADR-019/MESP-143 governance reconciliation)

The MESP-123 pre-merge corrective session and pre-Opus governance reconciliation are complete on branch
`feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, continuing Draft PR #66 against
`main`. This session resolved the findings from the independent Claude Opus 5 review and aligned repository governance:

- **F-1 (Currency Rendering Resilience)**: `formatMoney` in `SupplierQuotationWorkspaceComponent` now catches `RangeError` thrown by `Intl.NumberFormat` on valid non-ISO MESP currency codes (e.g. `S2K`, `CUSTOM`) and falls back safely to localized decimal formatting with raw currency code suffix (`1,234.56 S2K`). Quotation lists and detail headers render without crashing.
- **F-2 (Source Decision Concurrency Token)**: Fixed `SupplierQuotationService.RecordSourceDecisionAsync` to pass caller's `expectedVersion` parameter directly into `SupplierSourceDecisionCommand` rather than substituting `existingDecision?.Version`. In Angular `SupplierQuotationWorkspaceComponent`, `recordDecision()` now supplies `currentDecision()?.version ?? request.version` as `expectedVersion`, ensuring re-selections use the decision version and first selections use the Purchase Request version. Concurrency conflict (HTTP 409) is cleanly surfaced with a reload affordance and no false success notice.
- **F-5 & F-6 (Documentation & Bundle Reconciliation)**: Harmonized repository documentation, updated test counts (754 backend, 202 frontend unit, 8 Playwright E2E), measured production bundle size (478.57 kB initial total, 91.94 kB lazy quotation chunk), and recorded non-blocking P3 observations (F-3 SQLite fallback and F-4 quotation logging).
- **Governance Reconciliation (ADR-019 & MESP-143 Inheritance)**: Permanent architecture rules added to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Established that **Tenant != Workspace** (Tenant is the server-authorized isolation boundary; operational context is inside Tenant and aligns with Company/Branch; Platform Tenant Workspace is a separate MESP-67 control-plane concept); host resolution is candidate routing, not authorization; Overview loads before context switching; Wafra logo is generic Tenant branding configuration data under `frontend/assets` (never hardcoded logic); and Saudi Riyal symbol is a Saudi country-pack/SAR presentation asset with zero FX/tax/accounting effect. MESP-143 remains Planned/To Do and is not implemented in this session.

## Historical authoritative position - 16 August 2026 (MESP-123 pre-Opus SQL safety connection separation and documentation reconciliation)

The MESP-123 validation harness reconciliation is complete on branch
`feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, continuing Draft PR #66 against
`main`. This session introduced a permanent architectural separation between
the persistent MESP application runtime variable and the disposable SQL
safety-test variable; restored an all-green backend baseline; and fixed the
root README badge link, Run.md, backend/README.md, TASK.md Opus instructions,
and ADR-018.

| Current fact | Verified position |
|---|---|
| Branch / PR | `feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`; Draft PR #66 remains open, Draft, and intentionally unmerged. No Jira or external-tracker operation was performed. |
| SQL variable separation | `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` is the persistent owner Development DB connection (SQL Server `.` / `MESP`). `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING` is the dedicated disposable LocalDB safety-harness connection (`(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` / `MiniErpFoundation_*`). The two variables are non-interchangeable and the safety fixture fails closed if the dedicated variable is absent or points at a non-LocalDB/non-MiniErpFoundation target. |
| Safety harness change | `SqlServerSafetyFixture.InitializeAsync` now reads only `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING`. One new architectural boundary test `Runtime_connection_string_is_not_accepted_as_safety_configuration` proves the runtime variable cannot authorize destructive safety execution even when set. |
| Safe backend test runner | `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` is a new dedicated safe test runner. It constructs a disposable `MiniErpFoundation_*` connection in process memory, assigns it only to `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING`, runs the full suite, and restores/clears the variable in a guaranteed `finally` block. `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` is never modified. |
| validate-foundation.ps1 | Updated to assign the disposable connection to `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING` (not the runtime variable) and restore/clear it in `finally`. `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` is never read or modified by this script. |
| Documentation | `README.md` badge link corrected (removed misleading MIT license link); Quality checks section updated with the two-variable table and reference to the safe runner. `Run.md` adds the SQL Server connection variable separation section. `backend/README.md` header note updated with the harness separation. `docs/ADR-018` adds the Connection variable separation section. `TASK.md` Opus step 5 corrected to use the dedicated variables and the safe runner, not the runtime variable. |
| Validation baseline | Release build: **0 warnings / 0 errors**. Backend suite: **753/753 passed** (was 731/752; 22 SQL safety tests now genuinely execute, not gated). Angular: **197/197 across 22 spec files**. Playwright: **6/6**. npm audit: **0 vulnerabilities**. Disposable DB `MiniErpFoundation_20260816144340_f60651c6` created/dropped cleanly; no orphan DBs remain. `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` in User environment: unchanged throughout. |
| Next exact continuation | Claude Opus 5 independent MESP-123 capability review per the corrected TASK.md Opus instructions. |

## Historical authoritative position - 16 August 2026 (MESP-123 Supplier Quotation / Comparison UI)

MESP-123 B2 remains complete at its bounded shared-shell, workspace-routing,
server-configured Tenant display, local Development-auth, representative
Purchase Request UI, local SQL Server cutover, and branding reconciliation
scope. The bounded Supplier Quotation / Comparison Angular UI is now present
on branch
`feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, continuing Draft PR #66
against `main`. Phase C Supplier Quotation/comparison/source-decision
backend/API behavior remains intact.

| Current fact | Verified position |
|---|---|
| Branch / PR | `feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`; Draft PR #66 remains open, Draft, and intentionally unmerged. This session performed no Jira or external-tracker operation. |
| B2 implementation head | `fd3dd4952cbb9c5eea38eefc5de3955c56faf7d2` (`chore(MESP-123): cut local Development runtime to SQL Server`) is the committed B2 implementation head; documentation synchronization is `d16198e`, final runtime state is `f2ac881`, and the mapped-row reconciliation is committed with this handoff. |
| Supplier Quotation UI scope | Final pushed documentation head is `65b9fe94d262417520744c8cafc8fbf642928b5d`; implementation commit is `d5e2aad1b3e7f07a93940ce8cc0d0d70a577c5f7`. Lazy list/create/edit/detail routes are wired into the normal shell. The UI uses Approved Purchase Request lineage, server-provided organization names, Supplier/Currency/Tax/Payment Term references, evidence references, server capability flags, If-Match/idempotency mutation headers, comparison groups, explicit mixed-currency/no-FX treatment, required source rationale, current decision, persisted decision history, lifecycle history, audit, and technical references. The only backend addition is the Tenant-scoped source-decision history read operation over existing persisted records; no schema or migration changed. |
| Spec Kit | Spec Kit 0.16.4 was initialized and audited on an isolated clean `chore/adopt-spec-kit` branch at current `main`; generated `.agents/skills/speckit-*` and `.specify/*` state is preserved only in the local stash `spec-kit init generated adoption review`, with no commit, push, or merge. |
| Workspace routing | `/app/workspaces` is the canonical authenticated shell route. `/tenant/select` redirects compatibly into it. The selector is rendered once in the normal shell; the duplicate right context rail was removed. |
| Tenant naming | Context candidates render the server-provided `displayName`. Generic configuration supports arbitrary Tenant labels and the Development fixture can render `Wafra`; no client-side Wafra branch or GUID-first label exists. |
| Development auth | `POST /api/v1/auth/development-bypass` is Foundation-catalogued and OpenAPI-documented. It is explicit `MESP_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true`, exact-Development, loopback-only, server-actor based, no-body/no-client-identity, disabled by default, and fails closed outside Development. |
| Local SQL Server | A nonblank `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` selects SQL Server server `.` / database `MESP` for normal exact-Development. Formal migrations run Tenancy → Master Data → Business Parties → Procurement with distinct `dbo.__EFMigrationsHistory_*` tables; production startup never auto-migrates. Tenancy alone owns the physical `tenancy.TenantOwnedRecords` table; module alignment migrations are no-op database migrations. |
| Development data cutover | The dedicated inventory-first utility imported 59 mapped SQLite rows with IDs, Tenant IDs, foreign-key lineage, and source hashes verified. Two recoverable timestamped backups exist under the Development backup directory; SQLite source files and their original hashes remain retained. The local runtime journey added only Development proof data to the existing quotation/source-decision tables; no migration or production data was changed. |
| Angular shell | Sidebar exposes Overview, Workspaces/Tenant Selection, Master Data, Price Lists, Master Data Import, Purchase Requests, and Supplier Quotations. |
| Shared UX | Reusable global surface/page-header/grid/toolbar/status/state/technical-reference tokens are adopted by Workspace/Tenant Selection and representative Purchase Request list/detail screens with EN/AR, RTL/LTR, focus, reduced-motion, responsive, and accessible seams. |
| Validation baseline | Release build is 0 warnings/0 errors; the complete backend suite is 731/752 with 21 SQL safety cases blocked by the harness requirement for the machine-supported LocalDB provider; Angular is 197/197 across 22 spec files; production build is 478.57 kB initial with a 91.72 kB quotation lazy chunk; automated Playwright is 6/6; `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 0 vulnerabilities. The new local SQL-backed API journey passed quotation create/edit/submit, withdraw, disqualify, history/audit, mixed-currency/no-FX comparison, source decision, and source-decision history. No connected browser surface was available for a separate visual pass. |
| Runtime handoff | The official launcher restarted the pushed head on MiniERP API 5300 and Angular 4300 with SQL-backed Development configuration; health, module registration, repository-owned process paths, and read-only SQL inventory passed. RMS 5000/5001 remained untouched. |
| Scope exclusions | No Purchase Order, Supplier Confirmation, Goods Receipt, invoice, AP/accounting, payment, stock, supplier portal, external provider, credential, MESP-39, MESP-40, MESP-124, production migration/deployment, or broad redesign work was performed. Owner-managed source assets under `frontend/assets` remain unchanged; only generated browser derivatives changed. |
| Next exact continuation | Claude Opus 5 independent MESP-123 capability review of the complete bounded UI/API handoff. No Purchase Order. |

## Historical authoritative position - 15 August 2026 (MESP-123 Phase C backend/API handoff)

MESP-123 Phase C is complete at its bounded Supplier Quotation capture,
comparison, and source-decision backend/API scope on branch
`feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, continuing Draft PR #66 against
`main`. The existing Phase A Purchase Request backend and Phase B/B1
functional Purchase Request UI/integration seams remain the foundation; this
session did not change Angular source.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Branch / PR | `feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`; Draft PR #66 remains open and intentionally unmerged. No Jira or external-tracker operation was performed. |
| Quotation lifecycle | Tenant/company/branch-scoped Supplier Quotation capture, read/list, Draft edit, submit, withdraw, disqualify, history, and audit operations. Submitted quotations are internal recording of external supplier offers; the Supplier is not a platform User. |
| Purchase Request boundary | Capture and source decision require an Approved Purchase Request. Quotation lines preserve Purchase Request line identity, Product/UOM snapshots, requested and quoted quantities, prices, tax/discount facts, and requested need-by evidence. Edits do not rewrite the request. |
| Reference integrity | Existing active Supplier, Currency, Tax, and optional Payment Term ports are resolved server-side and useful commercial identities are snapshotted. Inactive, unavailable, foreign-Tenant, invalid, or out-of-lineage references fail closed. |
| Comparison | Deterministic server comparison exposes supplier/reference/status/validity, totals by currency, coverage, line facts, delivery/payment facts, evidence availability, and qualification issues. Mixed currencies remain explicitly incomparable without an approved FX basis; no hidden winner or ranking is produced. |
| Source decision | One current selected quotation per Purchase Request, with rationale, actor/time, policy/version/stage evidence, comparison snapshot hash/content, current selection flags, superseded history, and audit evidence. Reselection uses the current source-decision ETag; the first decision uses the approved request version. No Purchase Order is created. |
| Evidence boundary | Evidence is a bounded reference abstraction preserving identity/reference, filename/content type, description, source, actor, and time. No S3/Azure/provider, blob storage guarantee, supplier portal, or credential work was added. |
| REST/OpenAPI | Exact Foundation-catalogued `/api/v1/procurement/...` operations are mapped for list/read/create/edit/submit/withdraw/disqualify/compare/source-decision/history/audit, with antiforgery, idempotency, If-Match, audit, Tenant scope, and generated OpenAPI/Scalar descriptions. |
| Validation | Release solution build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused Supplier Quotation tests 5/5; full non-SQL backend 726/726; SQL safety 21 cases remain gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`; Angular is unchanged at 158/158 and 439.15 kB initial bundle. |
| Scope exclusions | No Purchase Order, Supplier Confirmation, Goods Receipt, invoice, AP/accounting, payment, stock mutation, supplier portal, external provider, credential, production infrastructure, statutory/ZATCA/FATOORA, MESP-39, MESP-40, MESP-124, or `frontend/assets` work. |
| Runtime handoff | Final Development restart is through `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1` on MiniERP API 5300 and Angular 4300; RMS 5000/5001 is unrelated and must remain untouched. |
| Next exact continuation | Claude Sonnet 5 - functional Supplier Quotation and Comparison Angular UI against this Phase C API. Keep the scope bounded, do not merge Draft PR #66, do not start Purchase Order, and stop after the UI handoff for review. |

## Historical authoritative position - 15 August 2026 (MESP-123 Phase A backend/API handoff)

MESP-123 Phase A is complete at its bounded backend/API scope on branch
`feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, based on starting main
`7eac2155982e7bedbe7a243a33b74998031dbfbe`. The implementation provides a
Tenant/company/branch-scoped internal Purchase Request Draft vertical slice:
Product/UOM/quantity/need-by/purpose lines; list/detail/create/edit;
submit/approve/reject/return-for-change/eligible cancel; immutable lifecycle,
approval, history, and audit evidence; configuration-led approval and bounded
delegation seams; self-approval/SoD enforcement; optimistic concurrency;
idempotency; Foundation authorization; and generated REST/OpenAPI/Scalar
contracts. It does not create stock, supplier commitment, Supplier Quotation,
Purchase Order, receipt, invoice, AP, payment, accounting, or any other
downstream commercial effect.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Branch / base | `feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval` from `7eac2155982e7bedbe7a243a33b74998031dbfbe`; Draft PR #66 is open against `main` and intentionally unmerged. |
| API surface | 11 Foundation-catalogued public Purchase Request operations with exact route, permission, Tenant scope, antiforgery, mandatory-audit, unsafe-effect, If-Match, and idempotency metadata; real endpoint mappings and generated OpenAPI/Scalar descriptions/responses are present. |
| Lifecycle / integrity | Draft → PendingApproval → Approved, Rejected, ReturnedForChange, or Cancelled; returned drafts can be edited/resubmitted; self-approval is denied; configured stages/delegation are scope/time/authority checked; history and audit are append-only evidence; request and line versions support optimistic concurrency. |
| Persistence boundary | Procurement owns its request, line, history, and audit tables/context. Product and UOM are read-only reference ports with server-resolved snapshots; no cross-module foreign keys or stock/AP/accounting behavior were added. |
| Validation | Release solution build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused Purchase Request tests 4/4; full non-SQL backend 718/718 (714 baseline plus four focused tests); SQL safety 21 cases remain gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`; Angular remains 158/158 and 439.15 kB initial bundle. |
| Scope exclusions | No Supplier Quotation, Purchase Order, receipt, invoice, payment, stock, AP, accounting, external provider, credential, Jira/external-tracker, migration/cutover, or production-volume/capacity/SLO work. `frontend/assets` was not touched. MESP-48 remains open. |
| Runtime handoff | Mandatory final restart is MiniERP API 5300 and Angular 4300; RMS 5000/5001 are unrelated and must remain untouched. |
| Next exact continuation | Claude Sonnet 5 — first visible Angular Purchase Request UI against this API contract. It must stay bounded to the Purchase Request journey, must not merge the Draft PR, and must stop after its UI handoff for review. |

The following MESP-122 closure is retained as historical repository evidence.

## Historical authoritative position - 15 August 2026 (MESP-122 source merged; final-main runtime closure complete)

The MESP-122 source capability and the bounded final-main runtime closure are
complete in the repository: PR #65 was
squash-merged to `main` at
`a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`, with parent
`a06cb3728dbfac6d05b2ce75458b06c265dde603`. The final reviewed feature head
was `5edcd3359945d1234dd7d4c95a5ef5f69514af33`; the bounded documentation-only
reconciliation head was `328d6d78088460ce0d8c945588ba9b9cef347c26`. Jira
closure is still pending GPT-5.6 Sol and was not changed by this repository
session. MESP-123 was not activated, and no SQL/provider/production-readiness
claim is made. The final Development runtime is on MiniERP 5300 and Angular
4300 through the official launcher, using the isolated
`.runtime/p1-1-runtime-fixture` store.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Authoritative repository evidence sequence | MESP-122 activation `11162`; Phase A `11163`; Phase B `11164`; Phase B serialization/asset correction `11165`; Phase C `11166`; Phase C1 `11167`; independent Opus full review / P1 identified `11168`; Opus P1-1 correction `11201`; targeted Opus approval / P1 closed `11202`. Prior MESP-121 final closure evidence is `11161`. |
| MESP-122 merge | PR #65 is **MERGED** via squash as `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`; that source merge has the single parent `a06cb3728dbfac6d05b2ce75458b06c265dde603`, and the current synchronized `main` includes it plus this bounded state/tracker reconciliation. |
| Opus P1-1 correction | `ReplayQuarantinedRowAsync` now distinguishes pre-execution `Validated`/`Commit` batches from post-execution terminal batches. A valid pre-execution replay remains `Accepted`/`Eligible`, preserves the validated batch state and original evidence/lineage, emits no mutation or false `batch.executed` audit, and leaves `ExecuteAsync` available. A valid replay after `Completed`/`CompletedWithErrors` commits immediately and recomputes the terminal state. DryRun and replay idempotency semantics remain unchanged. |
| Independent Opus final review | Initial review: P0 **0**, P1 **1**, P2 **9**; P1-1 corrected. Targeted re-review: P1-1 **CLOSED**, no new P0/P1; final decision **APPROVE FOR SQUASH MERGE**. |
| Finding 1 (execute confirmation integrity) | The execute confirmation dialog now sources Total Rows/Accepted/Rejected/Quarantined/Duplicate Policy/Batch Reference exclusively from `facade.batchReconciliation()` server evidence, never client-derived counts; Execute is blocked (dialog cannot open, button disabled) whenever reconciliation is absent or inconsistent, including if it becomes unavailable while the dialog is already open. Commit-mode batches with `Rejected > 0` or `Quarantined > 0` show an explicit EN/AR partial-eligibility warning. |
| Finding 2 (complete evidence tab) | The Evidence tab reuses the existing `loadBatchEvidence`/`getEvidence` contract only (no second evidence API) and renders Batch Evidence, Source/Provenance, Reconciliation Evidence, Row Evidence (historical/superseded rows visually and textually distinct), and Audit Evidence, with explicit loading/error/retry states and a per-batch staleness guard that prevents ever presenting evidence from a different batch than the one currently selected. |
| Finding 3A/3B (accessibility) | Row-detail and execute-confirmation dialogs implement a full focus-trap (Tab/Shift+Tab), safe initial focus (Cancel for the destructive execute dialog, heading for row detail, never a replay input), focus restoration to the opener on close, `aria-labelledby` bound to a real heading id, and Escape-to-close guarded against in-flight execute/replay requests. Batch-detail tabs implement a complete ARIA tabs pattern (roving tabindex, `role="tablist"/"tab"/"tabpanel"`, `aria-controls`/`aria-selected`/`aria-labelledby`) with ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End navigation and RTL-aware direction reversal. |
| Source / merge commit | The final reviewed source is at feature head `5edcd3359945d1234dd7d4c95a5ef5f69514af33`; the documentation-only evidence cleanup is `328d6d78088460ce0d8c945588ba9b9cef347c26`; both are included in squash merge `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`. No Owner asset was changed by the closure documentation commit. |
| Validation | Focused import/replay tests passed **11/11**; full non-SQL backend regression passed **714/714** (the three new P1-1 lifecycle regressions included); backend Release build passed 0 warnings/0 errors. Frontend was not changed and its full unit/component suite remains **158/158**; production build remains at a 98.52 kB import-workspace lazy chunk and 439.15 kB initial bundle, under the unchanged 500 kB hard budget. The 21 SQL Server safety cases remain honestly environment-gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`. `git diff --check` passed (benign CRLF-autocrlf informational warnings only). |
| Runtime verification | Backend and frontend were restarted through the official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1` launcher only, with the final runtime on MiniERP 5300 and Angular 4300; the unrelated third-party `Rms.Pos.ServiceManager.exe` on ports 5000/5001 remained untouched. The final Development runtime used the isolated `.runtime/p1-1-runtime-fixture` SQLite directory. Authenticated HTTP smoke passed through the Angular proxy for health/module registration, root/login/import routes, antiforgery, sign-in, session, server-returned context discovery/switch, Price List GET, generated OpenAPI and Scalar, every import read route, and all 11 runtime asset URLs. DryRun batch `65bcdcab-42f0-412b-afb7-e735b48cc407` remained `Validated` with committed count 0 and category count unchanged at 4. Commit batch `c67c5013-ba92-4f7f-b12d-946fa1378c38` passed `Validated` → `CompletedWithErrors` → post-execution replay `Completed`, with two committed rows, two `row.mutated` events, one `batch.executed` event, and preserved replay lineage. Browser-control setup found no connected browser, so visual browser verification is not claimed. |
| Repository hygiene | `git status --short -- frontend/assets` was empty before and after; all 10 protected Owner assets are present and unchanged. Deleted Owner assets: **NONE**. Only the intended backend correction, regression test, and state/tracker documentation changes are in scope. |
| PR / merge | PR #65 is closed as **MERGED** via squash at `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`; its description records the final Opus approval, P1-1 closure, test/build evidence, SQL gate, runtime proof, and non-blocking P2 observations. No Jira transition, comment, or other tracker write is performed here (owned by GPT-5.6 Sol). |
| MESP-23 | Remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register; no new decision or blocker was added by this bounded P1-1 correction session. |
| Deferred non-blocking P2 observations | P2-1 replay lifecycle backend coverage gap (mostly addressed by the new replay tests); P2-2 broad `*Import*` vocabulary exclusion; P2-3 untranslated English client parser errors; P2-4 no narrow-screen fallback below 720px for Preview/Audit/Evidence-row tables; P2-5 historical Jira-ID drift (corrected by this documentation cleanup); P2-6 parsed sequence row number can differ from physical source line after blank rows; P2-7 import idempotency database index is non-unique; P2-8 declared/enforced row payload bounds differ; P2-9 unexpected exceptions broadly map to `import_unavailable`. All except the documentation correction remain open, non-blocking follow-up observations; none is Release-1 completion evidence. |
| Exclusions preserved | No MESP-123 activation, no MESP-39 execution, no MESP-40 activation, no workspace redesign, no broad backend rewrite, no external provider/integration/credential/infrastructure work, no Retail POS or Wafra-specific core behavior, no Jira/external-tracker operation, and no production-readiness claim. |
| Current branch | Local `main` and `origin/main` are synchronized; the MESP-122 source squash commit is `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`; `TASK.md` remains intentionally MESP-122 and has not been replaced with MESP-123. |
| Next exact continuation | This bounded repository/merge/runtime closure is complete. Jira closure and MESP-123 activation remain owned by GPT-5.6 Sol; no next capability starts automatically from this session. |

## Historical authoritative position - 14 August 2026 (MESP-122 Phase B and Phase C complete; draft PR #65 open, unmerged)

MESP-122 remains **In Progress** in live Jira under Parent Epic `MESP-6`,
activation comment `11096`. Phase A (backend), Phase B (Angular nonvisual
integration seam — models, service, facade, RFC 4180 CSV/JSON parser, safe
error codes), and Phase C (the real Angular Master Data Import
Workspace/Wizard UI) are all now complete on the same branch
`feat/MESP-122-master-data-import`, still published as draft PR #65 against
`main`. The branch remains intentionally unmerged; MESP-122 remains open for
GPT-5.6 Sol planner verification and an independent Claude Opus 5 review
before any acceptance or closure.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-122 Phase B scope | Complete TypeScript import contracts/models and `IMPORT_RESOURCE_DEFINITIONS` for all 10 resources, an RFC 4180 CSV/JSON parser (`import-parser.ts`) with auto-mapping/validation/normalization, `MasterDataImportService` covering all 11 REST endpoints with antiforgery/idempotency/`If-Match` handling, a reactive `MasterDataImportFacade` signal store, and the full `SafeErrorCode` set for `import_*` backend error codes. No visual UI was added in Phase B. |
| MESP-122 Phase C scope | `MasterDataImportWorkspaceComponent` — a single reusable standalone component (list/wizard/detail modes from the route) implementing the sequential 6-step wizard (Resource & Policy → File → Column Mapping → Preview → Validation → Reconciliation/Execute) for all 10 resource kinds, accessible drag-and-drop upload, mapping badges, capped/paginated preview, facade-only create+simulate+execute, server-sourced reconciliation gating the Execute confirmation, an icon+text+badge row outcome table with filter/search, quarantine-only correction/replay, batch history (no Delete) and batch detail (Summary/Rows/Reconciliation/Audit/Evidence tabs), "Completed with errors" UX, complete EN/AR translation and RTL/LTR support, and ERP-appropriate responsive styling. No shell brand assets were changed. |
| Source commit | `2dbb3da`, pushed to `feat/MESP-122-master-data-import` (`4272df6..2dbb3da`); 8 files changed (2458 insertions, 4 deletions); no file under `frontend/assets` was touched. |
| Validation | Backend Release build passed 0 warnings/0 errors after clearing stale process locks; full non-SQL backend regression passed 711/711 (unchanged baseline); the 21 SQL Server safety tests remain honestly environment-gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`. Frontend unit/component tests passed 141/141 (110 pre-existing Phase A/B + 31 new Phase C workspace tests). Frontend production build passed with the import workspace as its own lazy chunk (88.97 kB) and a 437.19 kB initial bundle, under the unchanged 500 kB hard budget. `git diff --check` passed (one benign CRLF-autocrlf informational warning only). |
| Runtime verification | Backend and frontend were restarted through the official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1` launcher only (MiniERP on fallback port 5300, Angular on 4300; the unrelated third-party `Rms.Pos.ServiceManager.exe` on port 5000 was left untouched). A full authenticated HTTP-level journey was verified through the Angular dev-server proxy at the identical facade/service contract the component calls: antiforgery bootstrap, sign-in, context list/switch, DryRun `ProductCategory` batch create, simulate, and row outcomes (2/2 rows Accepted, `reconciliation.isConsistent: true`); all 10 protected/derivative brand assets returned HTTP 200. Visual browser verification was not performed because no browser-automation tool was available this session; this limitation is disclosed honestly rather than claimed as covered. Commit-mode execution was deliberately not exercised at runtime to avoid mutating persisted business data; its code path is already covered by the 711/711 backend and 141/141 frontend suites using the identical contracts. |
| Repository hygiene | Before/after `git ls-files frontend/assets` confirmed all 10 protected Owner assets present and unchanged; `git status --short -- frontend/assets` was empty. `.runtime/` (written by the launcher script) remains correctly gitignored (`.gitignore:17:/.runtime/`) and untracked. Deleted Owner assets: **NONE**. |
| PR / merge | Draft PR #65 description was updated with a new "### Phase C — Angular Import Workspace (Completed)" section and a "### Remaining" section; confirmed via `gh pr view 65 --json isDraft,url` that the PR remains **Draft** and is **not merged**.

## Historical authoritative position - 14 August 2026 (MESP-122 Phase A complete; draft PR #65 open)

MESP-121 is complete at its approved bounded Price List and deterministic B2B
pricing scope. The source implementation and corrections are merged to `main`;
focused PR #64 was reviewed at final head
`2f1d7fa20bc5adb591fd42e04519ee66931018db` and squash-merged to `main` at
`87be98f58d2d6de3f151ed3de0ef31276e682e5a`. Independent Opus 5 targeted review
approved the squash merge with findings P1-1 and P1-2 closed and no P0/P1
findings. Jira activation evidence is comment `11025`, Phase D evidence is
comment `11093`, validation/review evidence is comment `11094`, closure
evidence is comment `11095`, and MESP-121 is **Done**.

MESP-122 is **In Progress** in live Jira, activated under Parent Epic `MESP-6`
with activation comment `11096`. Phase A is complete at its bounded backend
scope on branch `feat/MESP-122-master-data-import`; the branch is intentionally
unmerged and the Jira item remains open for the sequential Gemini Phase B,
Sonnet Phase C, targeted review, and final acceptance handoffs.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-121 scope | Reusable Tenant-owned Price Lists, customer/product/currency applicability, effective-dated non-overlapping price versions, deterministic precedence and conflict resolution, controlled manual pricing where approved, immutable applied-price evidence, Active/Inactive lifecycle, audit, optimistic concurrency, idempotency seams, 10 Foundation REST operations with generated OpenAPI/Scalar reference, complete bilingual Angular Price List UI with EN/AR and RTL/LTR support, and Development runtime stabilization. |
| MESP-122 Phase A scope | Reusable Tenant-owned import batches, rows, source/provenance and replay lineage, durable batch/row/audit persistence, all ten generic Master Data processors, field/business/reference validation, duplicate policy, true dry-run simulation, row quarantine and replay, deterministic reconciliation/evidence, authorization, and Foundation REST/OpenAPI/read contracts. Source commit is `69173044445b5c40def397ff535b7e349083f0ac`; draft PR #65 is open. Gemini Phase B file/integration work and Sonnet Phase C Angular import UX are not started. |
| Pricing precedence & applicability | Current parent Price List currency/customer/organization/priority/lifecycle configuration governs current applicability and precedence; immutable child rows remain historical Product/UOM/effective/amount/scale/provenance/source/currency evidence. Proposed parent edits and cross-list appends fail closed on equal current precedence (`price_list_precedence_conflict`). |
| Master Data authorization | Production `AddMasterDataAuthorization()` registers a fail-closed resolver mapping exact trusted Foundation permissions to one Master Data capability; unknown/unrelated permissions deny closed, and the unconditional granting double is used only in isolated unit-test fixtures. |
| Repository hygiene | Pre-existing tracked `.vs` IDE/cache files (including `slnx.sqlite`) and transient Development artifacts were cleaned up. No cookies, auth tokens, passwords, SQLite DB/WAL/SHM, `.runtime` files, build output, or temporary logs are tracked. |
| Deferred non-blocking P2 notes | 1. Reactivation can create an equal-priority configuration if modified while inactive; runtime resolution fails closed safely with `price_list_precedence_conflict`. 2. Resolution audit resource labeling uses historical child scope metadata. Neither is a correctness/security blocker. |
| Validation | Release backend build passed with 0 warnings/errors; focused import tests passed 6/6; REST foundation tests passed 33/33; full non-SQL backend regression passed 709/709; Angular tests passed 68/68 across 11 test files; Angular production build passed with a 414.67 kB initial raw bundle under the unchanged 500 kB warning budget. Fresh runtime smoke passed on MiniERP 5300 / Angular 4301, including authenticated context selection, Price List GET, OpenAPI/Scalar, and an accepted import dry-run using an isolated fresh Development SQLite directory. The 21 SQL Server safety cases remain environment-gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`. |
| PR / merge | PR #64 remains the completed MESP-121 baseline on `main`; MESP-122 Phase A source commit `69173044445b5c40def397ff535b7e349083f0ac` is published in draft PR #65 against `main`. No MESP-122 merge or Jira closure has occurred. |
| Live Jira counts | 80 Done / 7 In Progress / 55 To Do across 142 issues; 80 Done / 2 In Progress / 45 To Do across 127 non-Epic issues (In Progress: MESP-23 and MESP-122). |
| MESP-23 | Remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register. No new business decision or blocker was added by MESP-122 Phase A. |
| Exclusions preserved | No retail promotions, POS, discount campaigns, loyalty, retail pricing, Sales Orders, Procurement pricing, Finance/AP/AR, credit limit (MESP-46), tax/accounting/rounding, automatic FX, MESP-39 execution, MESP-40 activation, migration/cutover, or Wafra-specific core behavior was executed. |
| Current branch | `feat/MESP-122-master-data-import` at `69173044445b5c40def397ff535b7e349083f0ac`, based on merged-main baseline `a06cb3728dbfac6d05b2ce75458b06c265dde6031`; draft PR #65 is intentionally unmerged. |
| Phase handoff | Phase A is complete; the next exact continuation is MESP-122 Phase B (Gemini 3.7 Flash) for JSON/CSV file/integration seams, Angular nonvisual state/services, and test-harness integration. Phase B/C, Opus review, Sol acceptance, MESP-123, MESP-39, and MESP-40 are not started by this session. |
| Next exact capability | `TASK.md` contains **MESP-122 — Implement Master Data import, audit/report integration, and downstream references**. Activated under MESP-6; MESP-51 (PD-041) and MESP-53 (PD-042) are consumed; MESP-50 remains an open production-policy boundary. |

## Historical authoritative position - 14 August 2026 (MESP-121 Phase G targeted Opus P1 corrections complete; draft PR #64; superseded by MESP-121 merge)

MESP-121 remains **In Progress** in live Jira. Its activation evidence is
comment `11025`. This bounded Phase G continuation applied the two confirmed
Opus P1 corrections in source commit `0242656` on the required branch
`feat/MESP-121-price-list-b2b-pricing`; the prior Phase D evidence remains
comment `11093`. Draft PR [#64](https://github.com/Hossam1104/mini-erp-saas-platform/pull/64)
must remain open, Draft, and unmerged; MESP-121 must not be transitioned to
Done and MESP-122 must not be started.

The earlier Phase A Price List backend, Phase C Angular implementation, and
Phase E/F runtime and sign-in corrections remain in the shared branch. Phase G
corrected only the confirmed Price List precedence/applicability snapshot
defect and the production Master Data capability resolver regression.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Phase G P1 corrections | Current parent Price List currency/customer/organization/priority/lifecycle configuration now governs current applicability and precedence; immutable child rows remain historical Product/UOM/effective/amount/scale/provenance/source/currency evidence. Active-list edit and append conflict checks use current parent configuration inside the existing Serializable transaction. |
| Authorization correction | Production `AddMasterDataAuthorization()` now registers a fail-closed resolver that maps the exact trusted Foundation permission to one Master Data capability; unknown/unrelated permissions are empty, and the prior unconditional granting resolver is not in production composition. |
| Repository hygiene | The pre-existing tracked `.vs` IDE/cache files, including `slnx.sqlite`, were removed in the bounded Phase G cleanup; `.gitignore` already protects `.vs/`. No cookies, session tokens, runtime passwords, SQLite DB/WAL/SHM, `.runtime` state, request scratch files, build outputs, or temporary logs are tracked by this branch. |
| Phase D cleanup | Tracked cookie/request-body files and SQLite WAL/SHM files were removed. `.gitignore` now protects the dedicated local runtime/smoke boundary and legacy Development SQLite names. No hard-coded smoke credential remains tracked. |
| Development persistence | The no-SQL-Server Development fallback now uses separate module-owned `masterdata.db` and `business-parties.db` files outside the repository, supports explicit directory/per-module overrides, initializes each schema fail-loud and idempotently, and has architecture coverage proving module isolation. |
| Production boundary | The configured `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` path is unchanged. Production keeps the approved `__Host-MiniErp.Auth`/Secure cookie contract; Development HTTP explicitly uses `MiniErp.Auth` with same-request security compatibility. |
| Frontend proxy | Tracked `frontend/proxy.conf.json` remains the generic `http://localhost:5000` fallback. The new Development launcher resolves an explicit `-ApiPort`/`-ApiUrl` or `MESP_DEV_API_URL`/`MESP_DEV_API_PORT`, writes ignored BOM-free `.runtime/proxy.conf.json` for that exact URL, and starts Angular with it. The official 5000 listener is an unrelated RMS service and was not stopped; the final runtime uses MiniERP 5300 with Angular 4300. |
| Runtime smoke | Frontend-origin module registration, sign-in, session, contexts, antiforgery, context switch, selected session, and Price List GET returned 200; `/login`, `/app/price-lists`, logo/favicon assets returned 200; backend-origin generated OpenAPI and Scalar returned 200 with the Price List operation present. MiniERP ran on 5300 and Angular on 4300 without disturbing RMS 5000. No fake Product/UOM/Currency/Customer records were added. |
| Validation | `dotnet restore` passed; Release backend build passed with 0 warnings/errors; focused Price List and Master Data authorization coverage passed 17/17; non-SQL backend regression passed 703/703; Angular tests passed 68/68; Angular production build passed with a 414.67 kB initial raw bundle under the unchanged 500 kB warning budget; runtime smoke and `git diff --check` passed. |
| SQL/provider gate | The 21 SQL Server safety cases remain environment-gated because `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` is unavailable. No SQL connection string was fabricated and no provider/production claim was made. |
| Jira counts | 79 Done / 7 In Progress / 56 To Do across 142 issues; 79 Done / 2 In Progress / 46 To Do across 127 non-Epic issues. |
| MESP-23 | Remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register. No new business decision or product blocker was discovered; the unrelated local port conflict was not treated as a product gate. |
| Planner/review state | The two Opus P1 findings are corrected and targeted regressions are green; planner acceptance, targeted Opus re-review, final review, merge, and Jira closure remain pending. No visual/browser sign-in claim is made; the authoritative UI-path evidence is the real Angular-origin HTTP sign-in/session/route/asset smoke. |
| Production percentages | Final project completion percentages remain unchanged. Runtime cleanup and local execution stabilization do not close SQL/provider/production, migration, legal/privacy, or specialist validation gates. |
| Exclusions preserved | No MESP-39 execution, MESP-40 activation, external provider/integration/credential/infrastructure, migration/cutover, Retail POS/promotions, Wafra-specific core behavior, Sales Orders, Procurement pricing, Finance/AP/AR, credit, tax/accounting/rounding, or automatic FX behavior was executed. |
| Current branch/head | `feat/MESP-121-price-list-b2b-pricing` at source correction commit `0242656`; final state/tracker synchronization remains on this same branch and draft PR #64. |
| Next exact continuation | Planner acceptance and targeted Opus re-review of MESP-121 on the same branch and draft PR. Do not merge, transition MESP-121 Done, replace `TASK.md` with MESP-122, or start another capability. |

The next review session must revalidate the complete shared branch and preserve
this bounded Phase G evidence. The tracked project statistics are synchronized
without changing final completion percentages.

## Historical authoritative position - 13 August 2026 (MESP-120 complete; PR #63 merged; superseded by MESP-121)

MESP-120 is complete at its approved bounded Exchange Rate and multi-currency
Master Data scope. The source implementation commit is `f4d6485`; focused PR
#63 was reviewed at final head
`f4d6485fd8b70a88ba34b68f1acae15a8c255ff6` and merged to `main` at
`14f6f4923d2897d891f33f5eb4405d2fe2089e69`. Jira activation, validation/review,
and closure evidence are comments `10990`, `11023`, and `11024`; MESP-120 is
**Done**. The required post-merge state, tracker, and root-task synchronization
is this handoff commit on synchronized `main`/`origin/main`.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-120 scope | Reuses the existing MESP-118 Currency master and adds Tenant-owned directional Exchange Rate configuration, effective-dated non-overlapping version history, deterministic applicable-rate selection, provenance/source notes, precision inputs, Active/Inactive lifecycle, audit, optimistic concurrency, idempotency seams, and immutable historical applied-rate reference evidence. |
| Ownership boundary | Master Data owns reusable configured currency/rate identity, effective history, safe reference selection, provenance, and reproducible applied-rate evidence. Finance owns realized/unrealized FX, revaluation, posting, period, rounding/accounting effects, reconciliation, and irreversible downstream consequences. |
| Approved decisions consumed | PD-033, PD-035, PD-036, PD-037, PD-043, PD-044, and PD-046, each only at its exact approved Master Data/Finance-reference boundary. The stale MESP-54 wording was reconciled by MESP-116/PD-043; no unapproved Finance behavior was promoted. |
| API/persistence/UI | Nine Foundation REST catalogue operations with generated OpenAPI/Scalar documentation and the required `effectiveOn` query contract; module-owned Exchange Rate persistence and integrity mappings reusing existing Currency references; bilingual Angular EN/AR RTL/LTR list/detail/history/create/edit/lifecycle/reference journeys; lazy-loaded Master Data workspace. |
| Validation | API build passed with 0 warnings/errors; focused Exchange Rate/REST/OpenAPI tests passed 35/35; full non-SQL backend/module suite passed 681/681; Angular tests passed 36/36 across 7 files; Angular production build passed with a 418.47 kB initial bundle and 119.65 kB lazy Master Data workspace, below the unchanged 500 kB warning budget. The 21 SQL Server safety cases remain environment-gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`. |
| Jira counts | 79 Done / 6 In Progress / 57 To Do across 142 issues; 79 Done / 1 In Progress / 47 To Do across 127 non-Epic issues after MESP-120 closure. |
| MESP-23 | Remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register. No new decision or blocker was discovered or added by MESP-120. |
| Exclusions preserved | No automated/external FX, providers, credentials, integrations, inverse/reciprocal/triangulated rates, bid/ask or market conventions, Finance posting/revaluation/rounding, automatic correction, Retail POS/promotions, MESP-39 execution, MESP-40 activation, migration/cutover, or Wafra-specific core behavior was executed. SQL/provider/production and Finance/Reporting specialist gates remain open. |
| Current branch | `main` is synchronized with `origin/main` after PR #63 merge; this post-merge commit synchronizes the tracker, current state, and root task. |
| Next exact session | `TASK.md` contains **MESP-121 - Implement Price List and deterministic B2B pricing capability**. It is To Do/not activated and must start only in a fresh session. |

MESP-121 remains the only next implementation capability. It covers Price List
identity, customer/product/currency applicability, effective-dated versions,
deterministic precedence, controlled manual pricing where approved, snapshots,
and downstream Sales consumption. It must not invent retail promotions or POS
behavior, activate MESP-39/MESP-40, or widen into Finance credit/accounting or
other capabilities.

The local MESP-120 implementation does not make a production-readiness claim
beyond its validated bounded capability. Finance/Reporting specialist
validation, SQL/provider/production, migration, privacy/legal, and named
external gates remain open before production or irreversible accounting,
valuation, close, revaluation, migration, or cutover decisions.

## Historical authoritative position - 13 August 2026 (MESP-119 complete; superseded by MESP-120)

MESP-119 is complete at its single bounded internal configuration-led Tax/VAT
Master Data and deterministic engine-contract scope. Source implementation
commit is `ec280a5`; focused PR #62 was reviewed at final head
`ec280a552f328416a52adbda212170a9c1c059fa` and merged to `main` at
`fd34dadb7fb96a680f61765ad3c67d3ec1a26572`. Jira activation is comment
`10987`, validation/review is comment `10988`, closure evidence is comment
`10989`, and MESP-119 is **Done**. The post-merge state/tracker
synchronization is the current tracked handoff commit on synchronized
`main`/`origin/main`.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-119 scope | Reusable Tenant-owned bilingual Tax/VAT identity, category/code configuration, Active/Inactive lifecycle, effective-dated non-overlapping rate versions, deterministic historical references, explicit-input calculation, applied-rate evidence, audit, optimistic concurrency, idempotent mutation seams, public REST, generated OpenAPI/Scalar developer reference, and connected Angular EN/AR/RTL journeys. |
| Ownership boundary | Master Data owns reusable Tax identity, configuration, effective selection, historical reference evidence, and the deterministic engine contract over explicit inputs. Finance owns accounting posting, valuation, period, reversal, reconciliation, and irreversible downstream consequences. |
| Approved decisions consumed | PD-024, PD-033, PD-035, PD-036, PD-037, PD-040, PD-043, and PD-046, each only at its exact approved boundary. No statutory, external, Finance posting, or migration recommendation was promoted to a requirement. |
| API/persistence/UI | Backend contracts, Tenant-filtered Tax/rate persistence, mandatory audit/concurrency/idempotency seams, ten public Tax REST operations, generated OpenAPI operation documentation, Development/QA-only Scalar v1 with its agent capability disabled, and bilingual responsive Angular Tax catalogue/edit/history/calculation journeys are implemented and tested. No external provider or production configuration was added. |
| Validation | API build passed with 0 warnings/errors; complete non-SQL backend suite passed 679/679; focused Foundation/REST/OpenAPI/Scalar suite passed 33/33; Angular tests passed 35/35 across 7 files; Angular production build passed with a 516.48 kB initial bundle, 16.48 kB above the existing 500 kB warning budget. The 21 SQL Server safety cases remain environment-gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`. |
| Jira counts | 78 Done / 6 In Progress / 58 To Do across 142 issues; 78 Done / 1 In Progress / 48 To Do across 127 non-Epic issues after MESP-119 closure. |
| MESP-23 | Remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register. No new decision or blocker was added by MESP-119. |
| Exclusions preserved | No statutory/ZATCA/FATOORA behavior, legal or government submission, Finance posting, migration/cutover, MESP-39 execution, MESP-40 activation, external integration/provider/credential/infrastructure, Retail POS, Wafra-specific core behavior, or other capability was executed. |
| Current branch | `main` is synchronized with `origin/main` after PR #62 merge; the required state/tracker/TASK synchronization is the final handoff for this session. |
| Next exact session | `TASK.md` contains **MESP-120 - Implement Exchange Rate and multi-currency master-data capability**. It is To Do/not activated, must independently reverify its PD-043/MESP-54 contract-bound prerequisites, and must start only in a fresh session. |

Finance/Reporting specialist validation, SQL/provider/production, migration,
privacy/legal, and named external gates remain open before production or
irreversible accounting, valuation, close, revaluation, migration, or cutover
decisions. This local implementation does not make a production-readiness
claim beyond its validated bounded capability.

## Historical authoritative position - 12 August 2026 (MESP-117 complete; superseded by MESP-118)

MESP-117 was the preceding bounded implementation session. Focused PR #60 was
reviewed at `4c183eac38a31637a15f873a80ee31557cd8e2bb` and merged at
`d406a6ef4fade3b8d3e95117ee10cfd41301ac60`; Jira activation, validation, and
closure evidence are comments `10977`, `10982`, and `10983`. It delivered the
shared Angular UX for Category, UOM, Product, Supplier, and Business Customer,
plus only the missing Category/UOM public REST seam. It consumed PD-033,
PD-035, PD-036, and PD-037 only at their approved Master Data boundaries.

## Historical authoritative position - 12 August 2026 (MESP-116 approved decision reconciliation; superseded by MESP-117)

The current Owner direction is the full-feature fast-track rebaseline. Release
1 remains a reusable full-feature B2B ERP. **31 August 2026 - Release 1

infrastructure, or production configuration. Existing approved BRDs and PD-023
remain historical/immutable evidence; current scope corrections are carried by
the fast-track overlay, PD-024, and the three canonical artifacts above.

## Historical authoritative position - 12 August 2026 (MESP-38 BRD complete; superseded by MESP-115 rebaseline)

MESP-38 - Produce Security, Audit, and Data Governance BRD is **Done** at
its approved bounded documentation-only scope. The canonical artifact is
docs/29_Security_Audit_and_Data_Governance_BRD.md. Focused PR #57 merged to
main at 67b7fb79475fb194489bc03ed153c999d20a6eaf from final reviewed head
42f2a1cb7b15580a6a92c4603253b6ea5104c203.

Jira evidence is activation 10934, validation 10935, Owner approval 10936,
MESP-23 handoff 10937, final pre-merge audit 10938, closure 10939, and the
Done transition metadata. The BRD contains 34 SADG-BR requirements and 40
SADG-GWT business acceptance scenarios. It added no source, tests,
persistence, schema, migrations, APIs, UI, providers, credentials,
infrastructure, production configuration, or production capability.

Live Jira and execution position:

MESP-39 remains To Do and is not activated automatically. Release 1 remains
the Saudi-localized Core ERP B2B baseline. MESP-23, MESP-48, MESP-50, MESP-53,
MESP-54, MESP-110, MESP-113, and named ADR/legal/external gates remain open at
their existing boundaries.

## Historical authoritative position - 12 August 2026 (Pre-MESP-38 reconciliation complete)

The verified merged reconciliation baseline is `main` at
`7ce1588ad20ea8ad1d82f6cafd39b370bedf0490`, the merge commit for focused PR
#56 from reviewed head `47195bcce103903775773e77788a1b53525d910c`. The bounded
reconciliation task **MESP-114 - Reconcile Pre-MESP-38 independent review
findings**, under governance Epic MESP-1, is **Done** with closure evidence in
Jira comment `10897` after activation evidence `10895`. This session was
documentation/Jira/governance only.

The Independent Opus 5 Pre-MESP-38 checkpoint verdict was **HOLD - CORRECTION
REQUIRED BEFORE MESP-38**, with 0 Critical / 2 High / 2 Medium / 2 Low
findings. The six finding IDs are O5-PRE38-001 through O5-PRE38-006. The
approved business architecture remains materially consistent; no redesign is
being performed.

No next task starts automatically. The corrected MESP-38 prompt must be
executed only in a fresh session after this reconciliation is reviewed,
merged, closed, and repository state is synchronized.

## Current authoritative position - 11 August 2026 (MESP-37 Saudi Localization BRD complete)

MESP-37 - Produce Saudi Localization and Compliance BRD is **Done** at the
bounded product-only documentation scope. The canonical artifact is
`docs/28_Release_1_Saudi_Localization_BRD.md`, v0.1 Approved bounded
product-only baseline. It defines Arabic/English, RTL/LTR, bilingual generic
ERP artifacts, configurable Saudi-oriented locale/timezone/SAR presentation
defaults, reusable Tenant-safe country-pack configuration, cross-module
ownership, fallback/error behavior, audit/configuration evidence, and business
acceptance scenarios. It adds no source implementation or production
behavior.

Focused PR #55 merged cleanly to `main` at
`7d03fa5b19226b8c6368012ec90c8a09eefd4aaf` from reviewed final head
`ff8eb5901d68a2cc366ed61722c08a7be53f50a1`. Jira evidence is activation
comment 10854, validation comment 10855, Product Decision Register
traceability comment 10856, Owner approval comment 10857, MESP-23 handoff
comment 10858, and closure comment 10859.

The approved scope is limited to the localization/core ERP slice. Statutory
tax/e-invoicing, ZATCA/FATOORA, legal/privacy-regulatory automation,
certification, external production integrations, provider/residency/retention/
backup/DR, Currency/MESP-54, Reporting/MESP-53, Finance/MESP-110,
supported-volume/MESP-48, MESP-50 governance, ADR-011, Retail POS, and
Wafra-specific behavior remain open, deferred, or out of scope as named. The
approval is not a legal, taxpayer-applicability, compliance, or production
claim.

Live Jira reconciliation is:

| MESP-112 / PD-023 | **Done / approved scope authority**; the current Saudi-localization boundary remains the MESP-112 overlay and PD-023. |
| MESP-111 | **Done**; readiness artifact remains historical evidence with draft-only/external-validation-outstanding verdict for future deferred areas. |
| MESP-22 | **Done / append-only**; MESP-37 added traceability comment 10856 and created no new Product Decision. |

This overlay supersedes the immediately prior MESP-112/MESP-111 handoff only
for the completed MESP-37 product-only BRD session. All earlier scope,
readiness, PRD, decision, and implementation history remains preserved. The
exact next session is in root `TASK.md`; this session must not execute it.

## Current authoritative position - 11 August 2026 (MESP-112 Saudi scope rebaseline)

MESP-112 - Rebaseline Release 1 Saudi localization and compliance scope is
complete at its bounded documentation/Jira/Product Decision/governance scope
under MESP-12. Its Owner-approved scope decision is recorded in
docs/27_Release_1_Saudi_Localization_Scope_Rebaseline.md and Product Decision
PD-023 appended to the immutable MESP-22 register. Jira activation evidence is
comment 10848. The task is not application implementation.

The current Release 1 product position is **Saudi-localized Core ERP Release
1** / **Saudi localization baseline** for reusable B2B ERP. Arabic, English,
RTL, bilingual core-ERP presentation/document/report boundaries, SAR/default
Saudi locale configuration, reusable country-pack architecture, Tenant
isolation, authorization, audit, and generic ERP capabilities remain in
scope. Release 1 contains no production external integrations, Saudi
statutory/tax-compliance functionality, ZATCA/FATOORA implementation or
certification, or dedicated legal/regulatory/privacy-compliance automation.
Those capabilities are deferred to separately approved future releases. This
is product scope, not a legal or taxpayer-applicability conclusion.

This overlay supersedes the immediately prior external-validation handoff only
for the Release 1 product-scope disposition. The earlier MESP-111 readiness
artifact, its historical verdict, the approved PRD, and all prior state
history remain preserved. The exact next session is in root TASK.md; this
session must not execute it.

## Current authoritative position — 11 August 2026 (MESP-111 readiness complete; MESP-37 remains To Do)

MESP-111 — Prepare Saudi regulatory evidence and external-validation readiness
is **Done** at its explicitly bounded documentation, research, traceability
and governance scope. The canonical artifact is
docs/26_Saudi_Regulatory_Evidence_and_External_Validation_Readiness.md.
Focused PR #53 merged cleanly to main at
1bcf1aa75292b927bc165a2a4fb1a8ca737763cf from reviewed branch head
51aee480319412ca43a7d97d1af295e1aab775d8. Jira activation evidence is
comment 10809 and closure evidence is comment 10810.

The verdict is **READY FOR MESP-37 DRAFT ONLY — EXTERNAL VALIDATION
OUTSTANDING**. The official-source and traceability pack is complete, but no
qualified Saudi tax/compliance adviser validation, qualified Saudi privacy or
legal adviser validation, Finance Controller decision, or Product Owner
decision set is recorded. MESP-37 remains **To Do** and was not activated.
MESP-49 and MESP-50 remain **To Do/open**; MESP-23 remains **In Progress**;
MESP-53, MESP-54 and MESP-110 remain preserved as open. No Product, Tax,
e-invoicing, PDPL, storage, credential, integration, or production source
behavior was added. Production-capability percentages remain unchanged.

The current branch is main at the merged MESP-111 baseline. The next exact
session is qualified Saudi external-validation and owner-decision handoff
only; it must not activate MESP-37 automatically. The canonical artifact and
TASK.md record the exact evidence gate. The PRD was structurally read; visual
rendering was attempted but unavailable because pdf2image and
LibreOffice/soffice are not installed, so no visual claim is made.

## Historical authoritative position - 11 August 2026 (MESP-36 Reporting BRD complete)

MESP-36 is **Done** as the bounded, documentation-only Release 1 B2B
Reporting and Analytics business baseline. The canonical artifact is
`docs/25_Reporting_and_Analytics_BRD.md`, v0.1 Approved Business Baseline.
Focused PR #52 merged cleanly to `main` at

`7022b24dc1c9ba6d02f9b77e0038b3e9b6211eeb`. Jira activation, validation,
Owner approval, final audit, MESP-23 handoff, and closure evidence are
comments `10769`, `10770`, `10771`, `10772`/`10773`, `10774`, and `10775`.

The Reporting BRD preserves MESP-53 as the critical open Reporting dependency
for final catalogue, KPI/figure definitions, named business and
reconciliation ownership, and scheduled/distribution policy. MESP-54 remains
To Do and unapproved for currency and exchange-rate policy. FIN-OD-09 /
MESP-110 remains To Do and unapproved for fiscal-year/year-end, Payment Term,
aging, and Finance posting-dimension policy. MESP-23 remains In Progress;
Currency remains unexecuted. No source, test, database, schema, migration,
EF, API, UI, provider, infrastructure, production, transactional, stock,
subledger, GL, or reporting mutation behavior was authorized or added.

The current branch is `main` at the merged MESP-36 baseline. No source
implementation item is active. The next exact task is MESP-37 Saudi
Localization and Compliance BRD only; it remains To Do and is not activated
automatically. Release 1 remains B2B ERP only, and the production-capability

## Historical authoritative position - 11 August 2026 (MESP-35 Sales BRD complete)

MESP-35 is **Done** as the bounded, documentation-only Release 1 B2B Sales
and Order-to-Cash business baseline. The canonical artifact is

e5daa1048e9c54f34a23f613929a8832c6d8f8c5. Jira activation, validation, Owner
approval, MESP-23 handoff, final validation, and closure evidence are comments
10762, 10763, 10764, 10765, 10766, and 10767.

Before activation, live Jira explicitly reverified MESP-109 as Done with the
accepted PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FINDINGS verdict and FIN-OD-09 / MESP-110 as
To Do and unapproved. MESP-110 remains the open Finance dependency for
fiscal-year/year-end, Payment Term Release 1 shape and due-date mechanics, and
Finance posting-dimension policy. This session did not define or approve any
of those details and did not resolve MESP-54.

MESP-34 remains Done, MESP-23 remains In Progress, and the 16-row
Jira-decomposed MESP-23 register remains 14 open rows plus the exact approved
MESP-52 / PD-020 and MESP-56 / PD-021 closures. Currency, MESP-36, MESP-37,
and implementation work remain unstarted. Release 1 remains B2B ERP only.

## Historical authoritative position - 10 August 2026 (MESP-34 Finance BRD Done)

MESP-34 is **Done** as the approved, documentation-only Release 1 B2B
Finance and Accounting business baseline. The canonical artifact is
`docs/23_Finance_and_Accounting_BRD.md`, v0.1 Approved Business Baseline. It
covers AP, AR, GL, journals, the Procurement/Inventory/B2B Sales posting
foundation, tax, cash/bank, periods, reconciliation, multi-currency,
statements, source-to-GL lineage, immutable posted history, reversal/correction,
permissions/SoD, failure/unknown outcomes, reporting, migration,
Saudi/localization, and explicit production gates. It adds no application
source, API, database/schema, migration, UI, provider, or production behavior.

Focused PR #47 merged cleanly to main at

reviewed at `7d9de5d1556114d443b95db9547d6c083dcd804d` and the second commit
records approval metadata only. Jira activation, validation, Owner approval,
final validation, and MESP-23 handoff evidence are comments `10746`, `10747`,
`10748`, `10749`, and `10750`; final MESP-34 closure evidence is comment
`10751`.

MESP-41 through MESP-55 remain open except the exact approved MESP-52 / PD-020
and MESP-56 / PD-021 scopes. The MESP-34 decision bundle preserves payment,
matching, approvals/delegation, negative stock/tracking dependencies,
migration, reports, exchange-rate, Saudi, retention, and volume decisions as
open or gated. No recommendation was promoted to a requirement. MESP-48,
MESP-49, and MESP-50 remain open production/external gates.

MESP-23 remains the only active governance item. No source implementation item
is active. MESP-35 B2B Sales and Order-to-Cash is the next separately
authorized To Do BRD under MESP-10, and Currency plus later work remain
unstarted. TASK.md contains only the exact MESP-35 handoff; do not execute it
automatically.

The canonical PRD was reviewed structurally. No visual-rendering claim is
made because optional LibreOffice/`soffice` support was unavailable.

Baseline. It covers the request-to-order-to-manual-supplier-confirmation to
receipt-to-invoice-to-payment chain, supplier returns, partials, exceptions,
permissions, approval/SoD boundaries, matching, audit, concurrency, reporting,
integration, migration, Saudi/external gates, and 28 business acceptance
scenarios. No application source, API, database/schema, migration, UI,
provider, or production behavior was changed.

Focused PR #45 merged cleanly to `main` at
`6dec81f3520decdf7d50ef40a44186988ba516d5`, from reviewed head
`9df9ac3df3383d6c7cdecc80a2889dc61997deaf`. Jira activation, validation,
Owner approval, and closure evidence are comments `10736`, `10738`, `10739`,
and `10740`. The MESP-23 living-register handoff is comment `10737`.

MESP-41 through MESP-55 remain open except the separately approved MESP-52 /
PD-020 and MESP-56 / PD-021. MESP-42, MESP-43, MESP-44, MESP-47, MESP-54,
and MESP-55 are represented as policy branches and implementation gates, not
answered by a recommendation. Suppliers remain external business parties and
never receive User, login, credential, Tenant-membership, or session semantics.
Retail POS and Wafra-specific core behavior remain excluded. MESP-48, MESP-49,
and MESP-50 remain open production/external gates.

MESP-23 remains the living open-questions register and the only active
governance item. MESP-33 is the next separately authorized **To Do** domain BRD
under MESP-8; it is not activated by this session. The root `TASK.md` now
contains only the exact MESP-33 Inventory and Warehouse Management BRD
handoff. Do not execute it automatically.

The canonical PRD text was structurally reviewed. Visual rendering was
attempted but could not run because the environment lacks the document
rendering dependency (`pdf2image`) and LibreOffice; no visual verification
claim is made.

## Historical checkpoint position - 10 August 2026 (MESP-108 Opus checkpoint reconciliation)

Independent Opus 5 issued **PASS - SAFE TO PROCEED TO NEXT DOMAIN** against
reviewed `main` baseline `4c25330055b7c5b64a2f351b22d143b91a2646be`, with
0 Critical, 0 High, 3 Medium, and 4 Low findings. MESP-108 is **Done** through
focused PR #44, merged to `main` at
`1f2db0a0b5ca0f39be8db06cc4c442c67b70e786` from reviewed head
`f1739660ccd3a008a2607984dcc5ee305682a802`. The
accepted evidence is recorded in
`docs/98_Independent_Opus_5_Checkpoint_Reconciliation.md`. No finding requires
a blocking source correction, and this session changes no application source,
test, schema, migration, endpoint, UI, provider, or production behavior.

The current normal backend gate is 670/670 non-SQL tests. The separately gated
21-case `SqlServerSafetyTests` suite is a disposable **Foundation-only**
LocalDB harness over `TenantPersistenceDbContext`; it does not validate
`MasterDataDbContext` or `BusinessPartiesDbContext`. The current backend
arithmetic is 670 non-SQL + 21 Foundation SQL = 691. SQL Server collation and
Arabic linguistic/search behavior for Master Data and Business Parties remain
unproved; ADR-011 remains required at its existing open/indexed status.

MESP-23 remains the living open-questions register. MESP-25 and MESP-26 are
Done; MESP-32 remains To Do and is not activated or executed here. The root
`TASK.md` contains only the exact next MESP-32 Procurement/Purchase-to-Pay BRD
session. MESP-48, MESP-49, and MESP-50 remain open production gates.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-108 | **Done**; documentation/governance reconciliation only; all O5-001--O5-007 findings accepted in `docs/98_Independent_Opus_5_Checkpoint_Reconciliation.md`; Jira validation/reconciliation comment `10732`; closure comment `10733`; exact finding-ID/live-state verification comment `10734`. |
| Review baseline | `4c25330055b7c5b64a2f351b22d143b91a2646be` on clean synchronized `main`. |
| Current branch | `main`; focused PR #44 merged at `1f2db0a0b5ca0f39be8db06cc4c442c67b70e786`; final handoff metadata synchronization follows on `main`. |
| Validation | Exact normal command passed 670/670; separately gated Foundation SQL suite contains 21 cases; no Master Data/Business Parties SQL-provider or production claim. |
| Jira handoff | MESP-25 Done; MESP-26 Done; MESP-32 To Do; MESP-23 In Progress; unresolved Procurement-affecting decision items remain open. |
| Next exact task | MESP-32 Procurement and Purchase-to-Pay BRD only, in a fresh session after this reconciliation is reviewed, merged, and closed. Do not execute it automatically. |

## Historical authoritative position - 10 August 2026 (MESP-23 reconciliation complete; MESP-106 hardening Done)

MESP-99 / M95-SL-02 Category and UOM, MESP-101 / M95-SL-03 Product identity
readiness, and MESP-102 / M95-SL-03 Product identity implementation remain
complete at their approved bounded scopes. MESP-103 closed the bounded
M95-SL-04 Supplier readiness/decision-gate item under MESP-6. MESP-104 then
delivered the separately authorized Supplier implementation through PR #39:
implementation head `9bf9afcd8a9ea427ed32b63ad9b655081e9592d3` merged to
`main` at `721adeb27c366d2b8aedde66d006ac6a49956f99`. Jira activation,
validation, and closure evidence are comments `10685`, `10686`, and `10687`.
Supplier source behavior is now present only within the bounded Supplier scope;
no migration, provider, or production-readiness claim was made. MESP-105 is
Done for the dedicated M95-SL-05 Business Customer readiness and decision-gate
item. Hossam's Customer-only Owner disposition is recorded in Jira comment
`10691`; MESP-107 is the separate and single Customer implementation item
under MESP-6, activated with Jira comment `10692`. Its bounded implementation
is complete and merged through PR #41 at
`fb632982d06fd4f6bf965fb15dff7701a0bddcec`. The implementation adds only the external B2B Customer identity,
Tenant-safe authorization, integrity, lifecycle, concurrency, audit, contacts,
contracts, routes, and module-owned persistence boundary; it does not add
statutory or downstream commercial behavior. MESP-106 is now **Done** for the
bounded shared hardening follow-up. PR #42 corrected Product/Supplier
authorization dependency-outage versus genuine-denial classification,
Supplier deterministic duplicate classification, and failure audit-evidence
preservation; Customer source behavior was unchanged.

MESP-23 remains the single In Progress non-Epic governance register. Its
bounded reconciliation is recorded in Jira comment `10731`: the register
retains 16 Jira-decomposed OQ-001--OQ-016 entries linked to MESP-41--MESP-56,
14 remain Open / To Do, and MESP-52 and MESP-56 remain the only answered
entries, preserved through PD-020/PD-021 and Jira comments `10062`/`10063`.
The canonical PRD v1.2 section 13.2 has 12 broader prompts; the 16-count is
the Jira decomposition, not a claim of 16 separate PRD paragraphs. No
unresolved decision was inferred or closed. MESP-48, MESP-49, and MESP-50
remain open external/performance/production gates.

| Correction commit | `e527f8a0cc32a72cef554e2bd93ab6322e9b1064`; PR **#34** merged cleanly with no configured CI checks. |
| Functional merge commit | `8364a67bce4d7d782115b7347e4e6607f02f9be4`; local `main` and `origin/main` are synchronized to this commit before the final metadata update. |
| Post-merge correction merge commit | `35417d35c076d1318474a7e4b31144cc9d94279b`; this is the merged correction code baseline, with final handoff metadata recorded in the subsequent `main` commit. |
| Category/UOM scope | Tenant-wide inside the owning Tenant; server-derived exact Category/UOM policy; no cross-Tenant sharing or client Tenant/scope authority; Active-on-create, Deactivate/Reactivate; three-level cycle-free Category hierarchy; quantity precision 6, conversion precision 8, positive factors, AwayFromZero rounding. |
| Persistence ownership | Module-owned Category/UOM entities, `masterdata` EF context/tables, Tenant query filters/ownership verifiers, append-before-effect audit transactions, and application-owned concurrency tokens in `MiniErp.Infrastructure`; no migration or production database provisioning. |
| Authorization/audit corrections | Identifier-aware M95-SL-01 exclusion scan; private validated audit-evidence construction; persistent first audit fidelity; authorized queries and commands; actual API module registration; Reactivate mapped to the existing Activate capability; persistence/audit-infrastructure failures map to `InternalFailure`; `parent_category_not_found` maps to `NotFound`; async Tenant ownership verification honors cancellation. |

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| MESP-100 | **Done**; closure evidence is Jira comment `10663`. |

| MESP-96 / M95-SL-01 | **Done**; remains contract-only and non-persistent. |
| ADR-002 | Published at `docs/ADR-002_Backend_Project_Structure_and_Module_Enforcement.md`; actual four-project roles and project-reference direction are explicit and tested. |
| Production project direction | `MiniErp.Api -> MiniErp.Infrastructure -> MiniErp.App -> MiniErp.Contracts`; Api also references App and Contracts for host composition; no cycle, fifth project, or microservice was introduced. |
| Authorization correction | Immutable server-owned `MasterDataOperationCatalog`: View->View, Create->Create, Edit->Edit, Activate->Activate, Deactivate->Deactivate, Approve->Approve, Import->ImportMigrate, ViewAuditHistory->ViewAuditHistory. Unknown/unmapped operations fail closed and callers cannot pair an unrelated capability. |
| Validation | Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; focused MasterData + ModuleBoundary tests 39/39 passed; non-SQL architecture suite 582/582 passed; `git diff --check` clean. |
| SQL safety gate | 21 existing SQL Server safety tests require the explicitly configured `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`; no credential or production infrastructure was invented. |
| Category/UOM implementation | None in MESP-100: no entity, table, DbContext, migration, repository, service, endpoint, persistence, or MESP-99 business behavior was added. |
| Owner bounds | MD-OD-001, MD-OD-005, MD-OD-008, MD-OD-002, and MD-OD-006 are recorded as Category/UOM-only bounds; the rest of MD-OD-001 through MD-OD-011 remains preserved and unresolved for other domains. |

| Source implementation | MESP-96 source implementation is now present only in the bounded non-persistent slice described above; no Product/Item, SKU/Barcode, tracking, availability, approval-catalogue, lifecycle, Wafra, Retail POS, migration, database, or endpoint behavior was added. |
| Current branch | `main`; the required state/task reconciliation content is published at `ecfe7f7` (`docs(MESP-96): reconcile correction handoff`), followed by the final metadata-only handoff update. |
| Main synchronization | The state/task handoff is synchronized through `e4f81c28de1728ea3a11a296c1547b3557b93311`; subsequent metadata-only handoff updates remain on `main`. The functional PR #31 merge is `4eeefe0d1a9af209cc3e31608812ec35ef283fd9`; the original PR #30 review thread is replied to and resolved, and no correction PR remains open. |

M95-SL-01 remains contract-only: no Master Data EF entities/tables, migration,
or `MESP` database creation/access solely for this slice; no Product/Item,
SKU/Barcode, tracking, business-availability, approval-catalogue, or
Draft/Active decision; no Wafra-specific behavior, Retail POS scope, or
M95-SL-02 work was added by the correction. The correction only repaired
optional target-hint handling in the existing resolver. ADR-002 and the actual
repository architecture remain authoritative; preserve the approved
`MiniErp.Api -> MiniErp.App -> MiniErp.Contracts` direction and do not invent a
new production project or topology.

Hossam has standing Owner approval for normal BRD/specification/readiness,
merge/closure, and next-session activation inside approved scope and
architecture. Each fresh Codex/Luna chat executes exactly one root `TASK.md`
session, validates, updates the handoff and affected Markdown/Jira, commits and
pushes, merges only when clean and unblocked, then STOPs for ChatGPT review.
Never automatically execute the next session. Independent Opus review is due
after every five completed sessions or earlier at a critical architecture,
security/Tenant-isolation, accounting, migration/data-model, or major
cross-module checkpoint.

## Current verified position — 8 August 2026 (MESP-31 closed; MESP-95 active)

The Stage-A and Stage-B gates are now sequenced and live. MESP-31 is closed
after its approved BRD merged, and MESP-95 is the single active
implementation-readiness item. The specification work remains documentation
only; no Master Data source implementation has started.

| Current fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Current branch | `docs/MESP-95-master-data-lean-implementation-spec`, created from merged `main` at `1dc4d2092d6e9a5bf8f6cfc3347e552a5ddbad1b` |
| MESP-31 | **Done**. BRD v0.3 is the Hossam-approved Release 1 Business Baseline; approval comment `10649`; closure evidence comment `10650`. |
| PR #28 | **Merged**. Final PR head `8396197b54189cb550f07bd4bb6779fd38ac30cb`; actual merge commit `1dc4d2092d6e9a5bf8f6cfc3347e552a5ddbad1b`; approved reviewed BRD head is an ancestor of `main`. |
| MESP-95 | **In Progress**. `Produce Master Data and Product Catalog Lean Implementation Specification`; Jira item already existed and was activated after the Stage-A exit gate. |
| Specification | `docs/17_Master_Data_and_Product_Catalog_Lean_Implementation_Specification.md`, Draft - implementation-readiness review; proposed slices only, no Jira children activated. |
| MESP-95 branch | `docs/MESP-95-master-data-lean-implementation-spec` |
| MESP-95 PR | **#29** — Open, non-draft, documentation-only readiness review; initial draft head `dc550e1171e8f9d20cd7fdf5509dfffb7537b3bd`. |
| Open decisions | MD-OD-001 through MD-OD-011 remain preserved and unresolved; the specification classifies their slice impact without answering them. |
| Other In Progress task | MESP-23 is the governance/open-questions register, not an implementation or readiness item. |
| Production gates | MESP-48, MESP-49, and MESP-50 remain open; no supported-volume, retention, privacy, legal-hold, purge, residency, backup, restoration, or production topology decision is invented. |
| Source implementation | **None**. No entities, mappings, migrations, database, repositories, services, endpoints, controllers, Angular implementation, or source tests were created. |
| Canonical approved PRD | `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx`; protected Git blob `1f9163b9412cb343a19a98312eb642ad26c1efaa` |
| MESP-95 review corrections | **M95-R01, M95-R02, and M95-R03** are the only findings addressed in this documentation-only session; MD-OD-001 through MD-OD-011 remain open/unresolved and no source implementation, migration, database, secret, or Jira child was created. |

The remainder of this file preserves the earlier pre-merge and historical
checkpoint narratives for provenance. This current section supersedes their
older live-state claims.

### MESP-95 correction-session handoff — 8 August 2026

- Session starting head: `d44ea29992ce1b927265c7fee4438ff888eca4f1` on
  `docs/MESP-95-master-data-lean-implementation-spec`. The attachment's
  earlier expected head `f4e3131c8f733ac3a92c7e9f83d8f2b970564d07` was
  superseded by the newer empty `TASK.md` commit and was preserved.
- M95-R01 corrects the durable-work/outbox maturity wording in the
  implementation specification; production SQL/durable persistence remains a
  later provider/production gate.
- M95-R02 records the post-merge MESP-31/PR #28 state without changing the
  approved BRD requirements or Open Decision Register.
- M95-R03 reconciles the contract-only SL-01 gate, first data-bearing gates,
  affected-domain Open Decisions, ADR-002/ADR-011 timing, and the generic DoR.
- Final correction commit and final PR #29 branch head are the single pushed
  documentation-only commit produced by this session; the exact SHA is the
  final PR #29 head recorded in the session completion report. PR #29 remains
  open and non-draft pending ChatGPT re-review.
- No Opus review, PR merge, Jira transition, Jira child creation, source
  implementation, migration, database, or secret action is authorized in this
  session.

## Historical position — 8 August 2026 (MESP-31 BRD v0.3 Owner Approved; PR #28 pending merge)

This section is preserved historical evidence from the MESP-31 approval/merge
sequence. It is not current guidance and must not be used as the entry point
for a new agent; use the current authoritative section at the top of this
file and the root `TASK.md` instead.

| Fact | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Current branch | `docs/MESP-31-master-data-product-catalog-brd`, created from verified `main` at `c86ecb851e88205f1d3907f5a5c36cfb59ce8b54` (PR #27 merge) |
| MESP-31 | **In Progress.** BRD v0.3 at `docs/16_Master_Data_and_Product_Catalog_BRD.md` is an **Approved Business Baseline**, approved by Hossam on 8 August 2026 in Jira comment `10649` at reviewed content head `1e2d055354f0ddde833190948d09fa426707484c`. Its Open Decision Register MD-OD-001 through MD-OD-011 is preserved; approval does not silently answer those decisions. No Master Data source implementation has begun. |
| MESP-31 Parent Epic | `MESP-6 — EPIC 06 - Master Data and Product Catalog` — verified against live Jira. |
| MESP-31 Owner authorizations and approval (in Jira) | Comment `10615` — BRD-entry authorization. Comment `10616` — future Master Data implementation authorization.

| MESP-31 Jira Source Baseline | Primary anchor **PLT-003**; supporting anchors PLT-002, SAL-001, PROC-002, PROC-008, FIN-001, FIN-003, FIN-007, FIN-010, KSA-002, BR-013, ADM-003, plus the applicable PRD RULE set for master-data integrity. PLT-011–PLT-014 and BR-004 are Platform Administration anchors and are **not** MESP-31's baseline. |
| PR #28 | **Open, non-draft, mergeable, unmerged, approved for merge after approval-state reconciliation** — `docs(MESP-31): draft Master Data and Product Catalog BRD`, branch `docs/MESP-31-master-data-product-catalog-brd`, base `main` at `c86ecb851e88205f1d3907f5a5c36cfb59ce8b54`. Approved reviewed content head: `1e2d055354f0ddde833190948d09fa426707484c`; the approval-state reconciliation is the remaining repository step before merge. Review-thread count is currently zero unresolved. |
| Prior verified `main` | `main` (before this branch) |
| PR #26 | **Merged** to `main` — approved final head `2c7ed3dec4662672bb78967ceb70db7ed73eb7d4`, ChatGPT final merge review **APPROVED FOR MERGE** (0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium blockers); actual GitHub merge commit `06d837c958c1cb7977dc121e3aaea4e7278944fd` |
| PR #25 | Merged to `main` at `9f333c9734c767673e43a30d6b57c05793e1fb69` — MESP-93 post-merge Markdown reconciliation |

| MESP-92 | Done — PR #22 merged to `main` at `322341e70e56270797d5770b4b90342c20b7833e` |
| MESP-91 | Done |
| Active Jira item | **MESP-31** (BRD finalization only; no source implementation) — after PR #28 merges and MESP-31 is closed, MESP-95 is the single next authorized implementation-readiness item |
| Foundation completion checkpoint | Performed 8 August 2026: MESP-92/93/94 Done; MESP-48/MESP-50 remain intentionally open production gates, not treated as blockers to MESP-31 BRD entry; no remaining Foundation correction ticket blocks BRD entry |
| MESP-31 (Master Data BRD) | **In Progress** — BRD v0.3 is an Owner Approved Business Baseline on open PR #28; MESP-31 is not yet Done until the PR actually merges and Jira closure evidence is posted. The eleven Open Decisions remain preserved and governed. No Master Data implementation has begun. |
| MESP-95 | **To Do** — `Produce Master Data and Product Catalog Lean Implementation Specification`; it becomes the single active item only after PR #28 merges, MESP-31 is confirmed Done in Jira, and no other implementation/readiness item is In Progress. |
| MESP-48 / MESP-50 | To Do — open production gates, preserved, intentionally not blocking BRD entry |
| Sprint | None active |
| Parallel implementation | None |
| Canonical approved PRD | `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx` |
| Hosted CI | None configured — all validation is local only |

### MESP-31 Owner-approval overlay — 8 August 2026 (pre-merge)

The historical review and correction sections below are preserved. The current
position is that Hossam approved MESP-31 BRD v0.3 as the Release 1 business
baseline in Jira comment `10649` at reviewed content head
`1e2d055354f0ddde833190948d09fa426707484c`. The approval preserves
MD-OD-001 through MD-OD-011 and silently resolves none of them; decisions
marked blocking remain implementation-slice gates. PR #28 is approved for
merge but remains open and unmerged until the approval-state reconciliation is
pushed and reverified. MESP-31 remains In Progress until its actual merge and
Jira closure. MESP-95 exists as To Do and is the next authorized item only
after the Stage-A closure gate. No Master Data source implementation has
started. MESP-48, MESP-49, MESP-50 and all qualified external-production gates
remain open.

### Post-merge focused verification (8 August 2026)

After PR #26 merged to `main` at `06d837c958c1cb7977dc121e3aaea4e7278944fd` (approved head `2c7ed3d` confirmed an ancestor, no divergence, no semantic merge edits), bounded focused verification was re-run directly on merged `main` rather than the full expensive suite (already run complete pre-merge at `037491cee8650bfd38c4fad4d58e3baa86a3e2a4` and targeted at final head `2c7ed3d`): `SafetyCatalogueValidationTests` + `SqlServerSafetyTests` **25/25** passed, `scripts/verify-foundation-validation-lock.ps1` **5/5** passed, `git diff --check` (working tree) and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` both passed, and 0 `MiniErpFoundation_*` databases remained after the run.

### MESP-31 BRD entry eligibility — RESOLVED 8 August 2026

`MESP-31 BRD ENTRY: ELIGIBLE — OWNER APPROVAL RECORDED.` The Foundation correction sequence blocking BRD entry (MESP-92, MESP-93, MESP-94) is complete, and MESP-48/MESP-50 are intentionally not entry blockers. `docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`'s "Next authorized sequence" step 9 required the MESP-31 BRD's entry conditions to be "reconfirmed" before starting; the precedent for that reconfirmation (MESP-29, see `docs/13_Multi_Tenancy_BRD.md` SC-001) was a distinct founder/owner authorization statement, not an automatic consequence of Foundation completion. Hossam recorded that distinct authorization on 8 August 2026, explicitly scoping MESP-31 to cover Products, Product Categories, Units of Measure, Suppliers, Business Customers, Price Lists, Taxes, Payment Terms, Currencies, and Exchange Rates, and separately pre-authorized the later Master Data implementation phase (not yet executable — see below). MESP-31 moved to In Progress on branch `docs/MESP-31-master-data-product-catalog-brd`, and a v0.1 draft BRD was produced at `docs/16_Master_Data_and_Product_Catalog_BRD.md`. Both authorizations are recorded in live Jira — comments `10615` and `10616`. **This BRD draft is not yet Approved** and does not itself authorize implementation; do not start Master Data implementation until Hossam explicitly approves the BRD content and a dedicated implementation Jira item, separate from MESP-31, is identified and activated.

### MESP-31 BRD review round — PR #28 (8 August 2026)

The v0.1 draft was published as **PR #28** at head
`6d0aa80eef0a2860c85a141dd6f13ee38bf5760d` and received a
business-requirements review verdict of **CHANGES REQUIRED BEFORE OWNER
APPROVAL / MERGE**. A bounded, documentation-only correction round produced
**v0.2** on the same branch and the same Pull Request — no replacement PR was
opened. The corrections were:

- **MESP-41** (batch/lot/serial/expiry scope) reclassified from a confirmed
  requirement to a *Recommended Founder Decision Pack default — pending
  Hossam approval*, and raised as new Open Decision **MD-OD-010**, blocking
  the Master Data implementation baseline and jointly dependent on MESP-33
  Inventory.
- **MESP-54** (exchange-rate sourcing and Finance approval) reclassified as
  *Deferred Gate / Recommended Default — not yet approved*, owned by
  Finance/MESP-34 and not approved by this BRD.
- **Approval controls** corrected: no approved source establishes a
  separate-approver rule for Tax or Price List changes, so both were
  withdrawn from Confirmed status into Open Decision **MD-OD-005**. Only the
  generic control remains Confirmed (MD-BR-046 — where an approved policy
  requires separate approval, the requester may not self-approve and
  publication is blocked until the approval exists).
- **Draft-before-Active** (MD-OD-008) treated consistently as an Open
  Decision rather than simultaneously Confirmed and open; the "no Draft
  state for Release 1" position is retained as a recommendation.
- **Lifecycle wording** corrected — a deactivated record becomes *Inactive
  and unselectable for new use*, not "Active-unselectable".
- **Business Party** duplicate semantics clarified in the BRD and the
  glossary: duplicate detection runs within a party role; a cross-role
  identity match between Supplier and Business Customer is surfaced for
  review and optional linkage and never auto-rejects the second role, since
  the approved glossary confirms the same legal company may be both. No
  unified Party record is introduced.
- **Organizational scope** separated into two questions: the Tenant
  ownership/isolation boundary (Confirmed and mandatory) versus
  Company/Legal Entity business availability (undecided, MD-OD-001).
  "Tenant-owned" is not read as "Tenant-wide usable by every Company", and
  no cross-Tenant shared business data is introduced.
- Parent Epic, the two Jira Owner-authorization comments, and the corrected
  Jira Source Baseline recorded as verified facts.

The Open Decision register now holds **ten** decisions (MD-OD-001 through
MD-OD-010). PR #28 remains **open and unmerged**, MESP-31 remains **In
Progress**, the BRD remains **Draft and not Approved**, and **no Master Data
implementation has started or may start automatically**.

### MESP-31 BRD second correction round — PR #28 (8 August 2026)

The v0.2 draft was reviewed at head `865701128c86d358f6aa919162c91d91ae025f21`
and received a further business-requirements verdict of **CHANGES REQUIRED —
FINAL SMALL CORRECTION ROUND**, raising four findings. A second bounded,
documentation-only correction round on the same branch and the same Pull
Request closed all four and produced **v0.3**:

- **M31-R10 (Product/Item modelling)** — MD-BR-015 ("Release 1 treats
  Product and Item as one concept; no separate variant layer") was classified
  Confirmed even though the approved glossary marks Item, SKU, and Barcode
  "Draft for BRD Validation" and explicitly defers Product-versus-variant
  modelling to this BRD. MD-BR-015 is withdrawn from Confirmed status and
  raised as new Open Decision **MD-OD-011**, carrying the same one-concept,
  no-variant-layer position forward only as the recommended option pending
  Hossam's approval. §11, §8, §42, and §43 are updated to match; no variant
  implementation is invented.
- **M31-R11 (residual approval assumptions)** — §27's "Routine
  identity/contact-detail edit ... No approval required — Confirmed" row
  assumed a position not established by any approved source, contradicting
  §27's own statement that the full approval catalogue is Open Decision
  MD-OD-005. The row is restated as a recommendation ("recommended not to
  require separate approval; final policy is part of MD-OD-005") and
  reclassified Open Decision (MD-OD-005). MD-AC-016 is reworded from "an
  authorized Approver publishes" to "an authorized actor publishes ... after
  satisfying any approval policy applicable under MD-OD-005," removing the
  residual assumption that a dedicated Approver role or specific approval
  requirement already exists. The generic confirmed control, MD-BR-046, is
  unchanged.
- **M31-R12 (Saudi launch language)** — MD-OD-007's blocking rationale
  ("can launch with VAT registration only and add fields later") made a
  production-compliance claim outside this BRD's business-analysis scope.
  The rationale now distinguishes BRD approval and the bounded Master Data
  implementation baseline (not blocked by MD-OD-007) from production launch,
  which remains gated by MESP-49 and qualified Saudi legal/tax validation of
  the required statutory fields and tax treatment. The **External Validation
  Required** classification is preserved unchanged.
- **M31-R13 (unrelated `.vscode/settings.json`)** — the PR #28 branch delta
  included `.vscode/settings.json`, introduced by unrelated commit `c5506e1`
  (a local Bitbucket-integration editor setting with no business-requirements
  content). The file is removed from the PR #28 branch delta by this
  correction commit; the setting was not altered globally, only its presence
  in this PR.

The Open Decision register now holds **eleven** decisions (MD-OD-001 through
MD-OD-011, adding Product/Item modelling as MD-OD-011). PR #28 remains **open
and unmerged**, MESP-31 remains **In Progress**, the BRD remains **Draft and
not Approved**, and **no Master Data implementation has started or may start
automatically**. The new reviewed head is the correction commit on this
branch — check `git log` on `docs/MESP-31-master-data-product-catalog-brd`
for the exact SHA, since this entry is written before that commit exists.

**MESP-94 PR #26 focused review corrections (7 August 2026):** a focused
ChatGPT review of PR #26 at reviewed head
`88146a733a65bd6070ae80a3c1b6d17c4a456efa` returned CHANGES REQUIRED BEFORE
MERGE, raising R1 (final catalogue content needs its own validation at the
exact committed SHA), R2 (`git diff --check` must cover the branch delta,
not just the working tree), R3 (guarantee
`MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` restoration), R4 (protect concurrent
validation runs from dropping each other's disposable database), R5
(unambiguous SQL-configuration-test counts), R6 (safety-catalogue parser
column counting) and R7 (bound SQL tool discovery instead of a full
recursive Program Files scan). All seven are closed at implementation SHA
`ac65e204ca4f134d4c3ae98e7871b936fe01c613`; see
`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`'s "Focused review
corrections (R1-R7)" section for the exact resolution of each and the
complete validation totals re-run at that commit. That correction round was
superseded by the F1-F2 round below.

**MESP-94 PR #26 F1-F2 focused review corrections (8 August 2026):** a
second focused ChatGPT review of PR #26 at reviewed head
`809a4da0e6e3804a6461e55ce34fdfaec0df690e` returned CHANGES REQUIRED BEFORE
MERGE, raising F1 (the R4 lock was session-scoped `Local\`, which does not
coordinate two processes for the same Windows user running in different
logon sessions, even though the shared automatic LocalDB instance is scoped
by Windows user, not by session) and F2 (recover safely from an abandoned
validation lock left by a prior owner that terminated unexpectedly). Both
are closed at implementation SHA `037491cee8650bfd38c4fad4d58e3baa86a3e2a4`:
the lock is now `scripts/FoundationValidationLock.ps1`, a Global-namespace
named mutex suffixed with the current Windows user's SID and ACL-restricted
to that SID, coordinating every validation run for the same Windows user
across sessions without serializing unrelated Windows users or letting one
open/signal another's lock; `Wait-FoundationValidationLock` recovers
ownership from a genuine `AbandonedMutexException` instead of treating it as
an ordinary competing run. A new focused, automated, multi-process
verification harness, `scripts/verify-foundation-validation-lock.ps1`,
proves all five required behaviors (active owner blocks entry to cleanup;
a second same-user process cannot bypass the lock; an abandoned owner is
recovered safely; the lock is released after normal completion; the lock is
released after a simulated failure) — 5/5 passed, re-run twice for
stability. See `docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`'s
"Focused review corrections (F1-F2)" section for the exact resolution of
each and the complete validation totals re-run at that commit. The
evidence-only documentation commit recording this correction and its
validation table is `a35e71a767abc124849bd70706722834517478ed`. At that
exact final head, `SafetyCatalogueValidationTests` + `SqlServerSafetyTests`
were re-run together (25/25 passed: 4 catalogue + 21 SQL configuration/
schema/probe tests, unchanged counts), `scripts/verify-foundation-validation-lock.ps1`
was re-run (5/5 passed), and both `git diff --check` (working tree) and
`git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` (branch delta) passed clean. MESP-94
remains In Progress pending a further focused review of PR #26 at its new
pushed head, which is this same commit unless a later commit supersedes it
— check `git log` on this branch for the true tip.

**MESP-94 started (7 August 2026):** transitioned Jira MESP-94 To Do ->
In Progress and created branch `fix/MESP-94-foundation-validation-evidence`
from `main` at `9f333c9734c767673e43a30d6b57c05793e1fb69` (PR #25 merge —
MESP-93 post-merge Markdown reconciliation, closing L-3's PR #25 provenance
gap since that merge SHA was not yet known when PR #25 itself was written).
MESP-94 makes the Foundation validation tooling, SQL evidence, safety-row
classifications (rows 40, 45, 66) and checkpoint documentation say exactly
what the repository proves; it closes H-2, H-3, M-3, M-6, M-10, M-12, M-13,
M-14, M-15, L-2, L-3 and L-5. See
`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`'s "MESP-94 correction"
section for the exact resolution of each finding and the source-implementation
SHA/validated-repository-SHA evidence model this correction introduces.
MESP-94 is **not** marked Done yet; it remains In Progress pending PR review,
merge and post-merge closure. MESP-31 remains To Do; no Master Data
implementation has started.

**MESP-93 closure (7 August 2026, historical — superseded by "Start here" above):** PR #24 merged to `main` at
`005c796629341ab9becfbc6d1abe2ae34b6a7332` after a focused ChatGPT security
re-review verdict of APPROVED FOR MERGE at reviewed head `83b0c0e`. Post-merge
validation on `main`, rerun (not copied from pre-merge): Release build **0
warnings/0 errors**; full backend regression **566/566** passed (0 failed, 0
skipped), including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes with no
`MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after teardown; Angular unit tests
**27/27** passed; Angular production build succeeded (351.02 kB initial /
87.80 kB transferred, unchanged); Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit
--omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported **0** vulnerabilities; `git diff
--check` clean. All original findings (M-1, M-4, M-5, M-7, M-8, M-9, L-4) and
all focused re-review findings (H93-01, H93-02, M93-01, M93-02, L93-01) are
closed. MESP-93 is marked **Done** in Jira. PR #23 was investigated and found
fully superseded by PR #24's own reconciliation content already on `main`
(identical or newer for every one of its 11 changed files); it was closed
without merge rather than conflict-resolved. MESP-94 is now the next eligible
Foundation correction (not yet started); MESP-31 remains To Do. The sections
below this line are the preserved historical record of the MESP-93
implementation and re-review correction sequence and are not the current
state.

**MESP-93 focused re-review correction (7 August 2026, historical):** a focused
ChatGPT/Copilot re-review of PR #24 at head `759eb04` returned CHANGES
REQUIRED BEFORE MERGE, raising H93-01, H93-02, M93-01, M93-02 and L93-01.
All five are closed at head `1820416`:

- **H93-01 (High) — closed.** A wrong-Tenant `DeliverAsync` call no longer
  mutates the owner Tenant's `TenantNotificationIntent` at all -- no
  `DeliveryState`, `FailureCategory`, `AttemptCount` or idempotency-ledger
  change, and no automatic dead-letter on the owner's behalf. The read for
  the denial result is taken under the same `syncRoot` lock as every
  legitimate mutation, closing the unlocked-mutation data race a Copilot
  review comment flagged.
- **H93-02 (High) — closed.** `INotificationRecipientAuthorizer` now
  live-revalidates the caller's own Tenant authorization path -- a
  structurally valid `TenantContext` was not previously proof of current
  authority. Both `OrdinaryMembership` (exact live Membership, Active,
  correct Tenant, no `SupportGrant` present) and `SupportGrant` (exact live
  grant/case, Active actor, not revoked, not expired, case still active, no
  `Membership` present) paths are live-checked with no cross-fallback,
  reusing the same authorization semantics as durable-work dispatch and
  reconciliation revalidation.
- **M93-01 (Medium) — closed.** `INotificationRecipientAuthorizer` is now
  registered in `AddIdentityAuthorization()` against the same
  `IdentityAuthorizationService` singleton every other Identity-owned port
  uses.
- **M93-02 (Medium) — closed.** `PrivateFileContracts.EvaluateLifecycleOutcome`
  reports a previously recorded `ChecksumFailed` or `Disposed` disposition
  with its exact classification instead of folding every non-`Available`
  state into `Expired`. `PrivateFileAccessOutcome.Disposed` was added for the
  new classification, shared between `ReadAsync` and `OverwriteAsync`.
- **L93-01 (Low) — closed.** `SafeFileName` no longer rejects an embedded
  `".."` substring (only the exact reserved names `"."`/`".."` remain
  rejected -- path separators already block real traversal), and no longer
  rejects U+200C/U+200D (ZWNJ/ZWJ), which have legitimate Arabic-script
  shaping uses and were outside the documented rejection policy. A missing
  U+2060 (word joiner) rejection test case was added.

28 new focused tests added (73 total in the MESP-93 suite), resolving all
four open Copilot review comments on PR #24. Full validation at head
`1820416`: Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**; full backend regression
**566/566** passed (0 failed, 0 skipped), including **11/11** SQL Server
LocalDB probes with no `MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after
teardown; Angular unit tests **27/27** passed (unchanged); Angular production
build succeeded (351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB transferred, unchanged);
Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported
**0** vulnerabilities; `git diff --check` clean. MESP-93 is **not** marked
Done; PR #24 is held open, non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused
ChatGPT security re-review at head `1820416`. MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain To
Do.

**MESP-93 implementation (7 August 2026):** closes seven findings against the
merged private-file (`PrivateFileContracts.cs`) and notification
(`NotificationContracts.cs`) seams, on branch
`fix/MESP-93-private-files-notifications` based on `main` at `322341e`.

- **M-1 (foreign vs missing file existence oracle) — closed.** `ReadAsync`
  and `OverwriteAsync` now return the identical `PrivateFileAccessOutcome.NotFound`
  for a foreign-Tenant object and a genuinely missing object.
  `PrivateFileAccessOutcome.TenantDenied` is preserved only as an internal
  safe audit-evidence classification recorded in the adapter's internal
  access-evidence list; it is never the outcome a caller observes.
- **M-4 (expired/invalid object overwrite) — closed.** `OverwriteAsync` fails
  closed with `Expired` or `ChecksumFailed` for any object whose disposition
  is not `Available`, whose `ExpiresAt` has passed, or whose live-recomputed
  checksum no longer matches the recorded hash, before the concurrency check
  is even reached. An invalid object is never silently replaced.
- **M-5 (unsafe Unicode filename controls) — closed.** `SafeFileName`
  normalizes to Unicode Normalization Form C, then rejects outright (rather
  than silently truncating) any filename containing a path separator,
  traversal sequence, control character, or one of the bidi/embedding/
  isolate/mark/zero-width format characters U+202A-E, U+2066-9, U+200E,
  U+200F, U+200B, U+2060, U+FEFF. Valid Arabic, mixed Arabic/English and
  normalized composed/decomposed filenames remain fully supported and compare
  equal after normalization.
- **M-7 (unbounded notification retry) — closed.** `TenantNotificationIntent.MaxDeliveryAttempts`
  (5) bounds retry; `InMemoryNotificationAdapter` transitions to a terminal
  `DeadLetter` state at the bound and never attempts delivery again
  afterward, regardless of further caller or duplicate-worker calls.
- **M-8 (unverified notification recipient) — closed.** `TenantNotificationIntent.Create`
  now requires a `VerifiedNotificationRecipient`, obtainable only through the
  new `INotificationRecipientAuthorizer` port. `IdentityAuthorizationService`
  implements it: a recipient must be an active `GlobalUser` with an active
  `TenantMembership` in the caller's exact Tenant; a foreign-Tenant, unknown,
  suspended, revoked or pending-invitation recipient is denied. The port
  takes a `TenantContext`, so `PlatformGovernanceContext` has no path to
  become Tenant notification authority.
- **M-9 (untested returned-content immutability) — closed.** New tests prove
  mutating a returned read/overwrite byte array, or the caller's own upload
  buffer after `StoreAsync` returns, never affects stored content or a
  subsequent read; the existing defensive-copy behavior was previously
  unverified by any test.
- **L-4 (dead enum member) — closed.** The unreachable
  `PrivateFileAccessOutcome.AnonymousDenied` member is removed; all
  consumers and tests updated.

45 new focused tests added in
`backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/PrivateFileAndNotificationSecurityTests.cs`.
Full validation at implementation head `85b9ec1`: Release build **0
warnings/0 errors**; full backend regression **538/538** passed (0 failed, 0
skipped), including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes with no
`MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after teardown; Angular unit tests
**27/27** passed (unchanged, no frontend files touched); Angular production
build succeeded (351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB transferred, unchanged);
Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported
**0** vulnerabilities; `git diff --check` clean. No production object
storage, public URL, signed download, malware scanner, production
notification provider or physical purge was introduced. MESP-93 is **not**
marked Done; the Pull Request for this branch is held open, non-draft and
unmerged pending a focused ChatGPT security review, the same standing gate
MESP-92 carried. MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain To Do.

**MESP-92 closure (7 August 2026):** PR #22 merged to `main` at
`322341e70e56270797d5770b4b90342c20b7833e` after a focused ChatGPT security
review verdict of APPROVED FOR MERGE at reviewed head `3ec6b45`. Post-merge
validation on `main`: Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; full backend
regression **493/493** passed (0 failed, 0 skipped), including **11/11** SQL
Server LocalDB probes with no `MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after
teardown; Angular unit tests **27/27** passed; Angular production build
succeeded (351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB transferred, unchanged); Playwright
**4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported **0**
vulnerabilities. MESP-92 is marked **Done** in Jira. The sections below this
line are the preserved historical record of the MESP-92 correction sequence
and are not the current state.

**H92-06/M92-07/L92-02 closure (7 August 2026):** a focused shipping-boundary
correction found that `MiniErp.App` still granted
`[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.Api")]` even after the H92-05/M92-05
correction made the effect guard, effect executor and their interfaces
`internal` — a friend assembly sees another assembly's internal members
exactly as if they were public, so that grant alone let the shipping
`MiniErp.Api` host reach `EffectGuard`/`EffectExecutor`, construct the guard
or executor directly, and call `TryReserve`/`Release`/`RecordCompleted`/
`RecordOutcomeUnknown`/`GetOutcomeUnknownReason` on the raw key. **Making a
member `internal` does not by itself prevent shipping access when the
declaring assembly grants that shipping assembly `InternalsVisibleTo`** — any
prior documentation implying otherwise is corrected by this entry. Both
findings are now closed at head `e991641`:

- H92-06 is closed: `backend/src/MiniErp.App/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` now
  grants `InternalsVisibleTo` only to `MiniErp.ArchitectureTests`; the grant to
  `MiniErp.Api` is removed. Rebuilding the full solution with that single
  change surfaced exactly one compile break in `MiniErp.Api`, unrelated to the
  durable-work ledger: `Program.cs`'s sign-in endpoint read the internal
  `FoundationHostSignInResult.Principal` to call `HttpContext.SignInAsync`.
  That property is now public — a narrow, intentional seam that exposes only
  the `ClaimsPrincipal` this module already issues through
  `FoundationIdentityClaims`, never a raw credential or ledger type. No
  mutable ledger type, guard, or executor was made public or given back
  friend access.
- M92-07 is closed by the same correction: `GetOutcomeUnknownReason` is
  declared only on the already-internal `IDurableWorkEffectGuard` interface,
  so removing `MiniErp.Api`'s friend grant removes its only path to that
  raw-key evidence as well. The sole production uncertain-effect evidence path
  remains `IDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync(VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization)`.
- L92-02 is closed: `frontend/angular.json` is restored to the exact
  `origin/main` analytics state (no `analytics` key), removing the unrelated
  identifier commit `9e0999e` had added. Verified byte-for-byte identical to
  `origin/main` for this file.
- `backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/FriendAssemblyPolicyTests.cs` is new
  (5 tests): reflection asserts `MiniErp.App`'s `InternalsVisibleTo` allow-list
  is exactly `["MiniErp.ArchitectureTests"]` (and contains no non-test
  assembly), and a Roslyn in-memory compilation proves source compiled under
  the assembly name `MiniErp.Api` fails with `CS0122` when it tries to
  construct `InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard`/`DurableWorkEffectExecutor` or
  call `TryReserve`/`Release`/`RecordOutcomeUnknown`/`GetOutcomeUnknownReason`,
  while the identical source compiled under `MiniErp.ArchitectureTests`
  succeeds. These tests were verified to fail against the prior (vulnerable)
  `InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.Api")` state before being verified to pass
  against this correction — they are a genuine regression proof, not just a
  restatement of the fix.
- O92-01, O92-02, H92-05 and M92-05 remain closed; all previously added tests
  for those findings continue to pass unmodified.
- Validation at this head: focused DurableWork/ledger/composition/
  reconciliation suite **238/238** passed (up from 230, the 5 new tests plus 3
  incidentally matched by a broader filter); full backend regression via
  `validate-foundation.ps1` **493/493** passed with 0 failed and 0 skipped
  (up from 488, the 5 new tests), including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB
  probes and no `MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after teardown;
  Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**; Angular unit tests **27/27** passed;
  Angular production build succeeded (351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB
  transferred, unchanged); Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev
  --audit-level=high` reported **0** vulnerabilities. MESP-92 is **not** marked
  Done; PR #22 remains open, non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused
  ChatGPT security re-review at this head. MESP-93, MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain
  To Do; no Sprint is active; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit production
  gates. The `local-prd-rename-before-MESP-92` stash was preserved untouched
  throughout this correction, and the canonical PRD blob
  (`1f9163b9412cb343a19a98312eb642ad26c1efaa` at `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx`) was
  not modified.

**Exact next action (historical — superseded, see the closure entry above):**
obtain a further focused ChatGPT security review of PR #22 at head `e991641`.
Do not merge PR #22, do not close MESP-92, and do not start MESP-93, MESP-94
or MESP-31 until that review authorizes the next step. The merge hold is a
standing process gate. **Superseded 7 August 2026:** that review completed
with verdict APPROVED FOR MERGE, PR #22 is merged, MESP-92 is Done, and
MESP-93 is now active — see "Start here" above.

**H92-05/M92-05 closure (7 August 2026):** a focused ChatGPT security
re-review of PR #22 raised H92-05 (`DurableWorkLocalRuntime` publicly exposed
the mutable effect guard, letting a shipping caller reserve, release,
complete or mark an effect uncertain outside the approved executor -- for
example releasing an in-flight reservation so a second dispatch executes the
same protected effect twice) and M92-05 (`IDurableWorkEffectGuard.GetOutcomeUnknownReason`
was reachable from a raw `DurableWorkEffectKey` alone, bypassing the H92-04
authorized reconciliation port). Both are now closed at head
`576996f94ae9ddc251767445a7ebddd60c492c45`:

- H92-05 is closed: `DurableWorkLocalRuntime`'s public surface is now limited
  to `Store` and `Dispatcher`. `EffectGuard` and `EffectExecutor` are internal
  properties, and `IDurableWorkEffectGuard`, `InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard`,
  `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor`, `DurableWorkEffectExecutor` and their
  state/reservation/execution-result types (`DurableWorkEffectState`,
  `DurableWorkEffectReservationKind`, `DurableWorkEffectReservation`,
  `DurableWorkEffectExecutionKind`, `DurableWorkEffectExecution`) are internal
  to `MiniErp.App`. No shipping caller outside this assembly's approved
  `DurableWorkEffectExecutor` can reserve, release, complete or mark an effect
  uncertain; `Store` and `Dispatcher` still share the identical internal
  guard and executor instance.
- M92-05 is closed: `IDurableWorkEffectGuard.GetOutcomeUnknownReason` is no
  longer reachable from any public type -- the interface itself is internal.
  The guard still preserves the O92-01 safe reason on its own `EffectRecord`;
  it is inspectable only through the internal/test-only seam
  (`InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.ArchitectureTests")`). The only publicly
  reachable uncertain-effect evidence path remains
  `IDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync(VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization)`.
- `DurableWorkEffectKey`, `DurableWorkEffectPurpose`, `DurableWorkProtectedEffectResult`
  and `DurableWorkProtectedEffectOutcome` remain public: the first two are
  required by the public `DurableWorkUncertainEffectRecord` reconciliation
  evidence, and the latter two are the return-type contract a handler author
  implementing `IDurableWorkHandler<TPayload>` must produce.
- 14 new structural/architecture tests were added in
  `DurableWorkEffectLedgerSurfaceTests.cs`, including an executable
  attack-regression test that blocks a handler mid-effect, proves no publicly
  reachable member can release the in-flight reservation, then completes the
  handler and a duplicate dispatch to confirm the effect still executed
  exactly once.
- O92-01 and O92-02 remain closed; all previously added O92-01/O92-02 tests
  continue to pass unmodified.
- Validation at this head: focused DurableWork/composition suite **230/230**
  passed (up from 216, the 14 new tests); full backend regression via
  `validate-foundation.ps1` **488/488** passed with 0 failed and 0 skipped,
  including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes and no `MiniErpFoundation_*`
  database remaining after teardown; Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**;
  Angular unit tests **27/27** passed; Angular production build succeeded
  (351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB transferred); Playwright **4/4** passed;
  `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported **0** vulnerabilities.
  MESP-92 is **not** marked Done; PR #22 remains open, non-draft and unmerged
  pending a further focused ChatGPT security re-review at this head. MESP-93,
  MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain To Do; no Sprint is active; MESP-48 and MESP-50
  remain explicit production gates. The `local-prd-rename-before-MESP-92`
  stash was preserved untouched throughout this correction, and the canonical
  PRD blob (`1f9163b9412cb343a19a98312eb642ad26c1efaa` at
  `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx`) was not modified.

**PRD path:** the approved PRD binary is unchanged. It moved from
`docs/MiniERPSaaSPlatform_PRD_v1.2_Final_Approved_Baseline.docx` to
`MiniERPSaaSPlatform_PRD_v1.2.docx` and now to `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx`. All
three paths resolve to the identical Git blob `1f9163b9412cb343a19a98312eb642ad26c1efaa`;
the move is recorded as a Git `R100` rename in commit
`271e9dfedce8e0ea44ef9f8d3ab6e6b61d984ac4`. Historical documents may say
"formerly `<old-name>`, now maintained at `docs/MESP_PRD_v1.2.docx`".

**MESP-92 findings after the Opus 5 project-wide review of 6 August 2026:**
0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium, 2 Low, none merge-blocking. Both Low findings
were closed by the bounded correction at head
`9dc6cb82860b10215d05364f2f6e25f69df3b986` (7 August 2026). A subsequent
focused ChatGPT security re-review of PR #22 at that head then raised H92-05
(High) and M92-05 (Medium); both were closed by the bounded correction at head
`576996f94ae9ddc251767445a7ebddd60c492c45` (7 August 2026; see the H92-05/M92-05
closure entry above). A follow-up shipping-boundary correction then found that
closure incomplete — H92-06 (High) and M92-07 (Medium), plus the unrelated
L92-02 (Low) scope cleanup — all now **closed** by the bounded correction at
head `e991641` (7 August 2026; see the H92-06/M92-07/L92-02 closure entry
above). No known MESP-92 code finding remains open at this head, pending the
next focused ChatGPT security re-review.

- **O92-01 (Low) — closed.** `InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard.RecordOutcomeUnknown`
  used to accept a `safeReason` and discard it. The guard now persists the
  sanitized reason on its own `EffectRecord` and exposes it read-only through
  `IDurableWorkEffectGuard.GetOutcomeUnknownReason`; the existing
  Reserved-only write guard already makes the transition one-way, so a
  duplicate or different-reason call cannot replace an already-recorded
  reason. An unsafe, empty or unbounded reason fails closed with
  `ArgumentException`. No public mutation surface was added.
- **O92-02 (Low) — closed.** `InMemoryDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync`
  used to fall back to `message.NextAttemptAt` when `OutcomeUnknownAt` was
  null. `DurableWorkItem` now carries its own `OutcomeUnknownAt` (set only on
  the `OutcomeUnknown` transition, mirroring `TenantOutboxMessage`'s existing
  field), and the read port fails closed with a generic
  `InvalidOperationException` — no work item id, tenant id or internal type
  name — instead of substituting `NextAttemptAt` or any other timestamp.

**Verified maturity boundary:** `DurableWorkLocalRuntime`,
`InMemoryDurableWorkStore`, `DurableWorkDispatcher` and
`TenantDurableWorkWorker` are **not referenced by `MiniErp.Api`**, and as of
the H92-06 closure at head `e991641` `MiniErp.Api` also no longer has
`InternalsVisibleTo` friend access to `MiniErp.App`'s internal ledger surface
at all. The durable-work seam is a contract plus a local adapter with test
coverage; it is not composed into the running host and is not a production
capability.

## MESP-92 In Progress — single-effect durable work and immutable payloads

- MESP-92 (`Guarantee single-effect durable work execution and immutable typed
  payloads`) is **In Progress** on branch
  `fix/MESP-92-single-effect-immutable-payloads`, based on merged-main baseline
  `32a91f27bc162685fc0db0f38b031d02ffbc99d2` (MESP-91 Done through PR #20/#21).
  PR #22 received a first focused ChatGPT security review that raised H92-01,
  H92-02, M92-01 and M92-02 (closed in the prior overlay entry below), then a
  second focused ChatGPT review that raised H92-03, H92-04, M92-03, M92-04 and
  L92-01; this entry records that second round of corrections. PR #22 remains
  open, non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused ChatGPT re-review.
- H92-03 is closed: `DurableWorkEffectComposition.CreateSharedExecutor()` is
  removed. `DurableWorkLocalRuntime.Create(operationCatalogue, payloadRegistry)`
  is the single approved composition entry point; it is the only place
  allowed to construct `InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard`,
  `DurableWorkEffectExecutor`, `InMemoryDurableWorkStore` and
  `DurableWorkDispatcher` (all four constructors are now `internal`), and it
  supplies the identical executor instance to the store and the dispatcher.
  `InMemoryDurableWorkStore`'s optional self-creating executor parameter is
  removed; an executor is always required. A syntax-tree architecture test
  scans the whole `backend/src` tree — every shipping project, including
  `MiniErp.Api` — and fails if any of the four types is constructed anywhere
  outside `DurableWorkLocalRuntime.cs`. That test is load-bearing because it
  matches only direct `new` expressions rather than relying on accessibility
  alone. **Historical note, corrected by the H92-06 closure below:** at the
  time this paragraph was written, `MiniErp.App` still granted
  `InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.Api")`, so the `internal` constructors alone did
  not yet stop the shipping host from building an independent ledger; that
  friend-assembly grant is removed as of head `e991641`.
- H92-04 is closed: `IDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync` now takes a
  server-issued `VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization` instead of a
  raw `TenantContext`. `IdentityAuthorizationService` (as the new
  `IDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorizer`) live-revalidates actor, session,
  Membership-or-SupportGrant validity and the dedicated catalogue-backed
  `work.reconciliation.read` permission, and reuses the same
  organization-scope ownership/containment logic as MESP-91 dispatch
  revalidation (`IsCurrentScopeContainedUnsafe`) so a missing or malformed
  selected scope fails closed. `TenantWorkScope.ContainsDescendant` then
  filters returned records to the authorized Tenant/Company/Branch/Warehouse
  boundary and its verified descendants only; a sibling organization and
  another Tenant are never visible. `PlatformGovernanceContext` has no path
  into this authorizer.
- M92-03 is closed: `DurableWorkUncertainEffectRecord` now carries the exact
  `DurableWorkEffectKey` (so `OperationId` is always present and `EventId` is
  present only for an Outbox-purpose record), the exact verified
  `TenantWorkScope`, `OutcomeUnknownAt` and a preserved safe reason.
  `TenantOutboxMessage` gained explicit `OutcomeUnknownAt`/`SafeFailureReason`
  fields; the prior reuse of `NextAttemptAt` as the occurrence time and the
  hard-coded `"outcome_unknown"` outbox reason are both removed.
- M92-04 is closed: every exception a registered payload codec raises --
  including one raised as `DurableWorkPayloadException` itself -- is
  normalized by `DurableWorkPayloadRegistry` to one of its own fixed, safe
  messages; the original exception is never attached as `InnerException`.
  `DurableWorkPayloadException`'s constructor is `internal`, so only the
  envelope/registry seam can raise one with a trusted message.
  `OperationCanceledException` still propagates unwrapped; checksum-mismatch
  and oversized-payload rejections keep their own approved fixed messages.
- L92-01 is closed: `DurableWorkLifecycle.OutcomeUnknown` and
  `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` documentation now say a caught post-boundary
  exception, a caught cancellation, provider-reported uncertainty or a
  completion-recording failure observed by the running process -- never an
  actual process crash, which instead loses this in-memory ledger entirely
  and is not represented as any recorded outcome. Production durable crash
  recovery for this local Foundation seam remains explicitly deferred.
- H-5 is closed: submission immediately snapshots every payload into an
  immutable, checksummed `DurableWorkPayloadEnvelope` through an explicit
  `IDurableWorkPayloadRegistry`/`IDurableWorkPayloadCodec<TPayload>` pair. No
  original caller payload reference is retained by `DurableWorkItem`; every
  external byte access and every handler decode returns an independent
  defensive copy. Unknown payload types, handler/payload type mismatches,
  checksum tampering and oversized/malformed payloads fail closed before a
  handler runs. Payload type selection is a bounded registry-table lookup, not
  CLR reflection over payload-controlled data, and payload bytes never appear
  in audit or evidence.
- H-6 is closed and H92-01/H92-02 correct it further: `DurableWorkEffectKey`
  now carries a server-owned `DurableWorkEffectPurpose` (`Handler` or
  `Outbox`) plus, for an outbox effect, the immutable `EventId`, so a handler
  effect and an outbox effect for the identical Tenant/WorkItemId/OperationId
  never collide even when both are guarded by the same shared
  `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` (`DurableWorkLocalRuntime.Create()` is now the
  one application-level authoritative composition seam; see the H92-03 entry
  above). Reservation
  remains the single non-reversible boundary — every registered handler
  invocation and every outbox effect is routed exclusively through
  `ExecuteHandlerEffectAsync` (architecture-enforced). The protected callback
  now returns an explicit `DurableWorkProtectedEffectResult` outcome —
  `Applied`, `NotAppliedRetryable`, `OutcomeUnknown` or `TerminalNotApplied` —
  instead of a generic `DurableWorkHandlerResult`; a bare generic retry can no
  longer release a reservation after an effect may already have run. A
  caught exception or cancellation observed inside the running process after
  the reservation boundary yields `OutcomeUnknown` and is never automatically
  retried; only an interruption provably before the boundary permits bounded
  retry. Completed effects replay their exact recorded safe result on
  duplicate dispatch.
- M92-01 is closed: `DurableWorkLifecycle.OutcomeUnknown` is a dedicated,
  Tenant-scoped reconciliation state for both handler work items and outbox
  messages — normal polling never selects it, the generic outbox
  redelivery/replay hook refuses to restart it, and audit records the safe
  `work.outcome-unknown`/`outbox.outcome-unknown` events with no payload or
  provider exception text. `IDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync`
  is a read-only, scope-authorized reconciliation port (see the H92-04 entry
  above for the exact-scope authorization added on top of it). No production
  reconciliation UI or provider decision is implemented.
- M92-02 is closed: the production `DurableWorkPayloadEnvelope.TamperForValidation()`
  fault-injection hook is removed; checksum-corruption tests use bounded
  reflection over the private backing field in the test project instead. A
  custom payload codec's encode/decode exception is always wrapped in the
  safe `DurableWorkPayloadException`; the original message, CLR type name and
  any payload-controlled data are never surfaced or audited.
- M-2 is closed: `Barrier`-synchronized genuinely concurrent Tasks prove one
  lease winner under active/expired-lease contention, one effect winner under
  concurrent reservation, stale-completion rejection after reclaim, and one
  effect from concurrent duplicate submissions.
- L-1 is closed: `IRelationalDurableWorkStore`/`InMemoryRelationalDurableWorkStore`
  are renamed to `IDurableWorkStore`/`InMemoryDurableWorkStore`. The type and
  its documentation no longer imply relational, SQL-backed, process-crash
  durable, production-ready or distributed exactly-once behavior.
- Outbox delivery now reports explicit `Delivered` (Applied — never repeats),
  `RetryScheduled` (NotAppliedRetryable — bounded retry), `DeadLettered`
  (TerminalNotApplied or an exhausted retry budget — never repeats) or
  `OutcomeUnknown` (never automatically repeats; requires reconciliation)
  outcomes on `OutboxDispatchResult`.
- Maturity boundary, corrected: this Foundation adapter preserves a caught
  post-boundary interruption (an exception or cancellation observed inside
  the running process) as `OutcomeUnknown`. An actual process crash loses
  this adapter's in-memory guard and lifecycle state entirely — it is not
  represented as `OutcomeUnknown` or any other recorded outcome. Immutable
  payload snapshot and stable work/effect identities are Foundation-local
  guarantees; one automatic protected-effect execution is guaranteed only
  within this local, in-memory, non-crash-durable seam; production durable
  crash recovery and distributed exactly-once delivery remain deferred to a
  future SQL/durable provider; no production SQL work store, broker or
  production worker exists.
- Validation on this branch after the second focused-review correction:
  Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**; focused DurableWork suite
  **199/199** passed; full backend regression **457/457** passed, including
  **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes (no `MiniErpFoundation_*` database
  remained after teardown); Angular unit tests **27/27** passed; Angular
  production build succeeded; Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit
  --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported **0** vulnerabilities. MESP-92 is
  not marked Done; PR #22 is open, non-draft and held unmerged for a focused
  ChatGPT re-review. MESP-93, MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain To Do; no Sprint is
  active; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit production gates.
- Validation rerun by the Opus 5 project-wide review at head
  `271e9dfedce8e0ea44ef9f8d3ab6e6b61d984ac4`, local only (no hosted CI exists):
  Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**; backend regression **457/457** passed
  with 0 failed and 0 skipped, including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes;
  no `MiniErp%` database remained in `MSSQLLocalDB` after teardown; Angular
  unit tests **27/27** passed across 5 files; Angular production build
  succeeded at 351.02 kB initial / 87.80 kB transferred; Playwright **4/4**
  passed; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported **0**
  vulnerabilities. This rerun covered the **complete frontend regression**,
  closing the earlier gap where it had not been rerun after the second MESP-92
  correction.
- O92-01/O92-02 bounded correction at head
  `9dc6cb82860b10215d05364f2f6e25f69df3b986` (7 August 2026): both Low findings
  from the Opus 5 project-wide review are closed (see above). Focused
  DurableWork suite **216/216** passed; full backend regression via
  `validate-foundation.ps1` **474/474** passed with 0 failed and 0 skipped,
  including **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes and no `MiniErpFoundation_*`
  database remaining after teardown; Release build **0 warnings/0 errors**;
  Angular unit tests **27/27** passed; Angular production build succeeded;
  Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`
  reported **0** vulnerabilities. No known MESP-92 code finding remains open.
  MESP-92 is **not** marked Done; PR #22 remains open, non-draft and unmerged
  pending a focused ChatGPT security re-review at this head. MESP-93,
  MESP-94 and MESP-31 remain To Do; no Sprint is active; MESP-48 and MESP-50
  remain explicit production gates. The `local-prd-rename-before-MESP-92`
  stash was preserved untouched throughout this correction.

## MESP-91 correction overlay — merged and Done

- MESP-91 (`Enforce verified organization scope and worker authority revalidation in durable work`) is **Done**. No implementation item is currently active; MESP-92 is the next eligible correction.
- Branch: `fix/MESP-91-verified-work-scope-authority`, based on merged-main baseline `4eb1ef3ab094242cbb26ec9ab79b4037512e0d2d`; approved head `92bd9fd38912a062cc3723f46867258d54ca8127`; merged to `main` at `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890` (PR #20 normal merge). The branch was deleted after merge.
- The correction adds an Identity-owned verified Tenant -> Company -> Branch -> Warehouse resolver, authorization-context-bound scopes, and live worker/outbox authority revalidation immediately before handler/effect dispatch. Authority failure is a safe terminal `AuthorizationDenied` dead letter.
- PR #20 received a focused ChatGPT security review disposition of APPROVED TO MERGE (0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium blockers) before merge. MESP-31, MESP-92, MESP-93 and MESP-94 remain To Do; no Sprint is active and no next item was started before MESP-91 closure.
- No production provider, migration, broker, deployment, Retail POS, Wafra-core or ERP domain behavior is introduced. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit gates.

- Approved merged main baseline after MESP-91: `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890` (PR #20 normal merge; MESP-64/PR #18, MESP-61/PR #17, MESP-90/PR #16, MESP-89/PR #12 and MESP-63/PR #14 remain preserved in history).
- MESP-57: Done; Modular Monolith solution and module seam merged through PR #1.
- MESP-58: Done; trusted TenantContext and persistence isolation merged through PR #6, including the stored-owner security correction.
- MESP-87: Done; Tenant persistence guardrail hardening completed in the MESP-58 correction sequence.
- MESP-59: Done; authentication and authorization seam merged through PR #8 and reconciled after MESP-88/PR #9. Jira reconciliation comment: `10274`.
- MESP-88: Done; PR #9 merged at `723dc8e28b0a927750230b51b9d05e26d039038c`; the final reported baseline contained 161 passing tests.
- MESP-60: Done; PR #10 merged the bounded versioned REST/OpenAPI, trusted context, safe error, correlation, concurrency, idempotency and antiforgery foundation. No business transaction API is in scope.
- MESP-62: Done; immutable path-aware evidence, append-before-effect coordination, safe redaction, bounded telemetry hooks and the Foundation Backend Review Checkpoint package are merged.
- MESP-89: Done; PR #12 merged at `a1c5627b40e11b14a50736663c6da56cf11c9ef8` after focused ChatGPT approval and merged-main validation.
- MESP-63: Done; Angular 22 Wave 1 shell implementation merged through PR #14 at `ad9e6a7c40d229b564a7232ca62b3d70ec1fdc15` after the MESP-89 reconciliation cleanup.
- MESP-90: Done; the exact approved head was merged through PR #16 at `469ab863a5fc20f02d3ba674a97dceb969bbec75` after focused ChatGPT approval. MESP-63 remains Done and was not reopened.
- MESP-61: Done; PR #17 merged to `main` at `7db49a88e11232f055c2016b8bb033a61de629ec` after the typed durable-work/private-file foundation and merged-main validation.
- MESP-64: Done; PR #18 merged to `main` at `2002d1c25d39022b227e89b3d70f41a53de0408c` after disposable SQL Server LocalDB validation and merged-main regression.
- MESP-91: Done; PR #20 merged to `main` at `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890` after focused ChatGPT security review approval and merged-main validation. No implementation item is active; MESP-92 is the next eligible correction and no Sprint is active.
- No Sprint is active; MESP-63 was delivered outside a Sprint.
- MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit performance, retention, privacy, legal-hold, purge, residency, backup and restoration production gates.
- No physical migration, production/shared database, durable audit provider, OpenTelemetry exporter, production worker, file-storage provider, deployment, Retail POS or future ERP transaction implementation was introduced. MESP-63 is limited to the Angular shell and does not implement business transactions.
- Current state: MESP-57, MESP-58, MESP-87, MESP-59, MESP-88, MESP-60, MESP-62, MESP-89, MESP-63, MESP-90, MESP-61, MESP-64 and MESP-91 are merged and closed in the repository baseline; no implementation item is currently active.
- MESP-63 implementation baseline: commits `798d15d1aa1e53781df3a2683305e95ac3143890` and `46bf2d30f91ef00e9e450b59b8de0b3a2d34dbab` were merged through PR #14 at `ad9e6a7c40d229b564a7232ca62b3d70ec1fdc15`. The Angular 22/TypeScript standalone workspace provides modular core/features/shared structure, server-issued cookie session bootstrap, in-memory antiforgery token, server-confirmed context loading/switching, bilingual EN/AR direction switching, responsive accessible shell and safe state components. Focused Angular tests pass 8/8; the mocked Playwright Wave 1 smoke journey passes 1/1; production deployment and provider work remain excluded.
- MESP-89 merged-main validation: Release build passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors; the complete solution suite passed 247 tests with 0 failures and 0 skips, including 17 direct/HTTP production-graph host-security tests and the endpoint metadata/coordinator guard. The merged correction covers catalog-backed exact operation permissions, mandatory protected-write evidence, composite idempotency replay and separate eligibility/selection versions.
- Production limitations remain explicit: in-memory Identity/session, local append-only audit seam, local idempotency, unavailable MFA/fresh-auth provider, no SQL migration or production provider selection, no durable exporter, no deployment work. MESP-64 provides disposable LocalDB/provider evidence only; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain production gates.

## Completed MESP-90 security correction

- MESP-63 remains **Done**; it is not reopened.
- MESP-90 (`Prevent false logout when server session revocation fails`) is **Done** and is no longer active.
- Branch: `fix/mesp-63-signout-fail-closed`; PR #16 is merged to `main` at `469ab863a5fc20f02d3ba674a97dceb969bbec75` by normal merge after focused ChatGPT approval.
- The Angular correction preserves the authenticated session, selected context and current route when sign-out is unconfirmed; only confirmed HTTP 204 or server-confirmed HTTP 401 clears local state and navigates to `/login`.
- Validation record: 27 Angular unit/component tests passed; 4 Playwright journeys passed; backend scope is unchanged and the existing 247-test/0-warning/0-error baseline remains the required regression gate.
- No backend contract, provider, migration, database, business-domain, Retail POS, Wafra-core, MESP-61 or MESP-64 implementation work was introduced by MESP-90. No Sprint is active.

## Completed MESP-61 durable-work foundation

- MESP-61 is **Done**. Branch `feature/mesp-61-durable-work-private-files` was
  based on merged main `469ab863a5fc20f02d3ba674a97dceb969bbec75` and PR #17
  merged to `main` at `7db49a88e11232f055c2016b8bb033a61de629ec`.
- The bounded scope adds typed Tenant-aware durable-work identity, organization
  scope, initiator, lifecycle, lease, retry, dead-letter and optimistic
  concurrency contracts; a deterministic local relational outbox/inbox store;
  a typed dispatcher and one-item worker seam; provider-neutral notification
  intents/local adapter; and a private-file metadata/access/local adapter
  boundary.
- MESP-91 extends this merged seam with Identity-issued verified organization
  scope and live worker/outbox authority revalidation. This correction is now
  a merged-main capability (PR #20, `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`).
- Local adapters are test/development seams only. No broker, production
  notification provider, object-storage provider, production SQL provider,
  migration, retention, residency, legal-hold, purge, scanning or deployment
  behavior is selected. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit gates.
- Merged-main validation passed: backend Release build 0 warnings/0 errors and
  285 backend tests; Angular 27 tests, Playwright 4 journeys and production
  dependency audit also passed. No production provider, migration, purge or
  later ERP work was introduced.

## Completed MESP-64 foundation safety harness

- MESP-64 is **Done**. Branch `feature/mesp-64-foundation-safety-harness` was
  based on merged main `7db49a88e11232f055c2016b8bb033a61de629ec`; PR #18
  merged to `main` at `2002d1c25d39022b227e89b3d70f41a53de0408c`.
- ADR-018 defines the current-machine SQL Server LocalDB strategy: one
  disposable `MiniErpFoundation_*` database, Windows integrated authentication,
  fixture cleanup, no committed secret and no production/shared database.
- The harness adds provider-specific schema/index/rowversion/collation,
  Tenant-filter, stored-owner, relationship, transaction, idempotency and
  lease probes, plus the exact 75-assertion evidence report in
  `docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`.
- Docker/Testcontainers CI compatibility, production sizing, migrations,
  retention, residency, legal hold, purge, provider selection and deployment
  remain deferred. MESP-48 and MESP-50 are explicit production gates. No
  implementation item or Sprint is active and MESP-31 through MESP-40 remain
  outside scope.

## Foundation Completion Opus 5 checkpoint

- `docs/97_Foundation_Completion_Review_Checkpoint.md` records the complete
  sequential Foundation chain from MESP-57 through MESP-64, its PR/merge
  evidence, test totals, capability status, exact maturity boundaries and
  remaining production gates.
- The checkpoint is the historical documentation baseline. MESP-91 is merged
  and Done through PR #20; its merge does not authorize MESP-31, packages 2/3,
  Master Data/Catalog work, a Sprint, MESP-48/MESP-50 implementation or
  production deployment.
- MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit production gates; no core ERP BRD is
  implemented and no implementation item is currently active. MESP-92 is the
  next eligible correction.

## MESP-91 focused correction overlay — merged and Done

- The focused correction is implemented in source/test commit
  `4ed4b0588b613d492ce6c446ae963001b28f0eca`, with final evidence recorded
  through approved head `92bd9fd38912a062cc3723f46867258d54ca8127` on the
  merged `fix/MESP-91-verified-work-scope-authority` branch. It closes H91-03 by requiring
  OrdinaryMembership revalidation to receive a canonical explicit
  `Tenant:GUID`, `Company:GUID`, `Branch:GUID` or `Warehouse:GUID` scope;
  missing, malformed, marker, broader and sibling scopes fail closed. A
  SupportGrant context does not authorize from its display marker; its current
  case-bound stored SupportGrant scope remains authoritative.
- H91-04 is closed by one reusable exact-binding validator covering WorkItemId,
  Tenant, operation descriptor, correlation, exact Company/Branch/Warehouse
  boundary, execution TenantContext scope, authorization path, Membership or
  SupportGrant, actor and session. DurableWorkExecutionContext repeats the
  same defensive check. Only the Identity issuer is allowed by the structural
  architecture test to issue shipping verified authority, and the operation
  descriptor's mandatory security-evidence flag cannot be bypassed at work
  creation, handler registration, dispatch or live revalidation.
- The focused durable-work and authority regression set passes **102/102** with
  zero skips. The complete Foundation validation on this overlay passes
  **360/360** backend tests, **11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes, **27/27**
  Angular tests, **4/4** Playwright journeys, Release build with 0 warnings
  and 0 errors, and production dependency audit with 0 vulnerabilities.
- SQL evidence used the disposable `MSSQLLocalDB` instance with Windows
  integrated authentication; the LocalDB/model collation observed during the
  run was `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`. No `MiniErpFoundation_*` test
  database remained after teardown, both pre-merge and on merged `main`.
- PR #20 was approved by focused ChatGPT security review (APPROVED TO MERGE;
  0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium blockers) and merged by normal merge commit at
  `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`. MESP-91 is **Done**; MESP-92 is
  the next eligible correction; MESP-93 and MESP-94 remain **To Do**; MESP-31,
  Master Data implementation, Sprint work, production providers, migrations,
  MESP-48 and MESP-50 work remain outside this correction.
