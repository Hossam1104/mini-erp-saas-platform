# Current State

- Approved merged main baseline after MESP-89: `a1c5627b40e11b14a50736663c6da56cf11c9ef8` (PR #12 normal merge; pre-merge baseline was `ff4741392e593b298fc220fcf822352656cc6fc1`).
- MESP-57: Done; Modular Monolith solution and module seam merged through PR #1.
- MESP-58: Done; trusted TenantContext and persistence isolation merged through PR #6, including the stored-owner security correction.
- MESP-87: Done; Tenant persistence guardrail hardening completed in the MESP-58 correction sequence.
- MESP-59: Done; authentication and authorization seam merged through PR #8 and reconciled after MESP-88/PR #9. Jira reconciliation comment: `10274`.
- MESP-88: Done; PR #9 merged at `723dc8e28b0a927750230b51b9d05e26d039038c`; the final reported baseline contained 161 passing tests.
- MESP-60: Done; PR #10 merged the bounded versioned REST/OpenAPI, trusted context, safe error, correlation, concurrency, idempotency and antiforgery foundation. No business transaction API is in scope.
- MESP-62: Done; immutable path-aware evidence, append-before-effect coordination, safe redaction, bounded telemetry hooks and the Foundation Backend Review Checkpoint package are merged.
- MESP-89: Done; PR #12 merged at `a1c5627b40e11b14a50736663c6da56cf11c9ef8` after focused ChatGPT approval and merged-main validation.
- MESP-63: In Progress; Angular 22 Wave 1 shell implementation is active on `feature/mesp-63-angular-wave-1-shell-rtl` after the MESP-89 reconciliation cleanup.
- MESP-61 and MESP-64: To Do; no parallel implementation is authorized.
- No Sprint is active; MESP-63 remains outside a Sprint while its bounded delivery is completed.
- MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain explicit performance, retention, privacy, legal-hold, purge, residency, backup and restoration production gates.
- No physical migration, production/shared database, durable audit provider, OpenTelemetry exporter, worker, file-storage provider, deployment, Retail POS or future ERP transaction implementation was introduced. MESP-63 is limited to the Angular shell and does not implement business transactions.
- Current state: MESP-89 is merged and closed in the repository baseline; MESP-63 is the single active implementation item on its feature branch; MESP-61 and MESP-64 remain pending.
- MESP-63 implementation baseline: Angular 22/TypeScript standalone workspace with modular core/features/shared structure, server-issued cookie session bootstrap, in-memory antiforgery token, server-confirmed context loading/switching, bilingual EN/AR direction switching, responsive accessible shell and safe state components. Focused Angular tests pass 8/8; the mocked Playwright Wave 1 smoke journey passes 1/1; production deployment and provider work remain excluded.
- MESP-89 merged-main validation: Release build passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors; the complete solution suite passed 247 tests with 0 failures and 0 skips, including 17 direct/HTTP production-graph host-security tests and the endpoint metadata/coordinator guard. The merged correction covers catalog-backed exact operation permissions, mandatory protected-write evidence, composite idempotency replay and separate eligibility/selection versions.
- Production limitations remain explicit: in-memory Identity/session, local append-only audit seam, local idempotency, unavailable MFA/fresh-auth provider, no SQL migration/provider validation, no durable exporter, no deployment work. MESP-64 owns provider/schema validation; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain production gates.
