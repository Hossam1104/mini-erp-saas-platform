# Foundation Backend Review Checkpoint

> **Historical checkpoint — not the current state.** This document records the
> Foundation backend position as reviewed on 3–4 August 2026, at the point
> MESP-89 closed. Everything below is preserved as the baseline of that
> moment and is deliberately not rewritten. For the verified current position
> — merged-main baseline, active Jira item, open Pull Request and open
> findings — read [`.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`](../.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md) and
> [`docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`](94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md).
> The Foundation sequence continued after this checkpoint through MESP-63,
> MESP-90, MESP-61, MESP-64, MESP-91, MESP-92 and MESP-93 (all Done; MESP-93's
> PR #24 merged to `main` at `005c796629341ab9becfbc6d1abe2ae34b6a7332`) to
> MESP-94 (also Done; PR #26 merged to `main` at
> `06d837c958c1cb7977dc121e3aaea4e7278944fd`). The Foundation completion
> checkpoint following MESP-94 found no remaining Foundation correction
> blocking MESP-31 BRD entry. Hossam recorded the required distinct owner
> authorization on 8 August 2026; MESP-31 moved to In Progress with a draft
> BRD (v0.2, on open PR #28) pending Hossam's review and not Approved — see
> `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`.

> **Current Master Data approval overlay — 8 August 2026:** Hossam approved

> MESP-95 exists as To Do and is the next readiness item only after MESP-31 is

> The documentation-only readiness review is PR #29, open and non-draft, with

Status at the time of this checkpoint: MESP-89 is Done. PR #12 was approved by
focused ChatGPT review and merged to `main`; MESP-63 was the next authorized
implementation item.

## Architecture status

- Modular Monolith boundaries and dependency direction are implemented through
  the public Contracts seam; API does not reference application internals.
- Tenant persistence is explicit and session-bound. Query filters and stored
  owner checks remain the authoritative local isolation controls.
- Identity/session and policy authorization are represented by the MESP-59 and
  MESP-88 libraries; before MESP-89 they were not connected to the actual API
  host. MESP-89 supplies that host integration using the bounded in-memory
  provider, while production persistence, assurance and deployment remain
  downstream.
- REST/OpenAPI is versioned under `/api/v1`; every public operation has one
  catalog-backed descriptor carrying its stable identifier, security profile,
  exact permission, scope and assurance/evidence policy. Endpoint metadata,
  OpenAPI, the trusted resolver and downstream validation use that same
  descriptor; operation text cannot manufacture permission.
- Safe Problem Details errors exclude stack traces, provider details, foreign
  Tenant identifiers and unauthorized target identifiers.
- Correlation, optimistic concurrency and bounded idempotency are carried by
  the MESP-60 contracts. The implementation uses a composite
  `(authorized-binding, normalized-key)` namespace, explicit decisions,
  typed original-response replay and `finally` reservation cleanup.
- MESP-62 adds immutable evidence construction from trusted context, append
  before protected effect, retry linkage, and bounded structured-log,
  metric and trace hooks. No exporter is selected.
- MESP-89 adds the host cookie/session adapter, antiforgery bootstrap and
  validation, resolver integration, context selection endpoints, and routes
  every protected write through the non-nullable coordinator. Selected-path
  sign-out is evidenced before revocation; session-only sign-out is an
  antiforgery-protected lifecycle revocation with no Tenant/Platform business
  effect under its documented conditional evidence policy. Context switching
  validates the server `SelectionVersion` separately from candidate
  `EligibilityVersion`. The merged slice remains bounded and does not make the
  local provider production-ready.

## Security status

- Tenant isolation is preserved for reads and writes; no client Tenant header
  establishes authority.
- Global User identity is separate from Tenant Membership.
- OrdinaryMembership and SupportGrant evidence are mutually exclusive and carry
  exactly one trusted Tenant.
- PlatformGovernanceContext evidence has no Tenant and is purpose-bound.
- Session expiry/revocation, MFA and fresh-auth requirements remain represented
  by the approved identity seam and are not weakened by this slice.
- A Tenant read permission cannot authorize the probe write; SupportRead cannot
  substitute for another Support operation; and an unrelated active Platform
  permission cannot obtain Platform context.
- Mandatory evidence failure prevents the protected effect and successful
  idempotency commit; replay returns the original typed safe response rather
  than rebuilding mutable session state.
- Errors and evidence use allow-listed safe categories.
- Evidence contains no password, hash, token, cookie, raw authorization header,
  opaque MFA/recovery/invitation value, provider error, request/response payload,
  or unauthorized foreign target identifier.
- Evidence has no public or ordinary runtime update/delete/clear operation;
  ownership and path are immutable. The local store is append-only at its API
  and in-process storage level, not a database-level immutability guarantee;
  durable storage, retention and purge remain deferred.

## Data-design status

- The logical Foundation model and tenant-aware integrity decisions are approved
  in MESP-86 v0.4.
- Implemented persistence is the bounded Tenant-owned EF seam plus the local
  append-only audit validation store; no production audit database is selected.
- No physical migration was generated or applied.
- SQL Server provider/schema/index/collation/rowversion validation remains
  deferred to MESP-64.
- MESP-48 supported-volume evidence and MESP-50 retention, privacy, legal-hold,
  purge, residency, backup and restoration gates remain open production gates.

## UI readiness

The backend now exposes stable foundation contracts that can inform detailed
Foundation UI drawings. MESP-89 is approved, merged and Done, so MESP-63 may
start as the next sequential implementation item. The UI must support EN/AR,
RTL/LTR handling, safe anonymous/authenticated/expired/revoked states, and
server-confirmed context switching; no client-selected Tenant authority is
implied by these contracts.

## MESP-89 completion status

- The focused ChatGPT security re-review approved the corrected PR with 0
  Critical, 0 High and 0 Medium blockers.
- PR #12 merged to `main` at `a1c5627b40e11b14a50736663c6da56cf11c9ef8` and
  MESP-89 is Done in Jira.
- The completed correction covers F-01 through F-06 and the related exact
  permission, mandatory evidence, idempotency and context-version findings.
- Merged-main validation records 247 passing tests, 0 failures, 0 skips, and a
  Release build with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Production Identity persistence, external IdP, MFA/email/SMS providers,
  durable idempotency, durable audit/export, migrations and deployment remain
  explicitly absent. Provider/schema validation remains assigned to MESP-64.
- MESP-63 is now authorized as the next sequential implementation item;
  MESP-61 and MESP-64 remain To Do and must not run in parallel.

## Plan variance

- MESP-59 was reconciled to Done after PR #8 and the MESP-88/PR #9 correction;
  the Jira inconsistency was recorded before MESP-60 started.
- MESP-87 and MESP-88 were added as corrective implementation evidence without
  changing the approved business scope.
- MESP-60 and MESP-62 ran sequentially in the founder-authorized fast-track
  without a Sprint; automatic merge was allowed only after the documented gates.
- MESP-89 was a security exception: the corrected PR required focused ChatGPT
  review before merge; that review approved the change and the PR is now merged.
- The delivery plan and `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` were corrected from stale
  MESP-58/MESP-60 instructions to the verified current state.
- No unapproved ERP transaction, Retail POS, Wafra-specific, migration,
  exporter, worker, storage-provider, retention or purge scope was added.

## Remaining Foundation work

- MESP-89 — Foundation host authentication, antiforgery and evidence integration
  (Done; PR #12 merged at `a1c5627b`).
- MESP-63 — Angular Foundation shell (next authorized sequential item).
- MESP-61 — background processing foundation (To Do).
- MESP-64 — provider/schema/index validation (To Do).
- MESP-48 — supported-volume production gate.
- MESP-50 — retention/privacy/legal-hold/purge/residency/backup/restoration
  production gate.

## Review disposition

The focused ChatGPT security re-review completed the required MESP-89 gate and
approved PR #12 for merge. The merged-main evidence is recorded above. MESP-63
may now begin from the approved backend contracts; no additional Opus review is
required for this transition. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain production gates, and
MESP-61/MESP-64 remain pending.
