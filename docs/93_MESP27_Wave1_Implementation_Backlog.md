# MESP-27 Wave 1 Implementation Backlog

## Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Artifact | Proposed implementation backlog for SaaS Platform Administration Wave 1 |
| Status | Backlog proposal for review — not recorded in Jira |
| Authority | Approved MESP-27 BRD v0.10 and approved Wave 1 wireframes |
| Product boundary | Release 1 B2B ERP platform administration only |
| Owner for approval | Hossam |
| Jira action | None taken; no Epic, Enabler, Story, or Sprint has been created |
| Downstream work | MESP-28 and all Procurement, Inventory, Finance, Sales, and Retail POS work remain out of scope |

This is a backlog-authoring artifact. It does not authorize coding, alter the BRD, create implementation Stories in Jira, create a Sprint in Jira, or replace the owning BRDs and decisions named below.

## 1. Source map and extraction rules

### Approved sources

| Alias | Source | Use in this backlog |
|---|---|---|
| BRD | `docs/11_SaaS_Platform_Administration_BRD.md`, v0.10 | Business scope, rules, requirements, states, permissions, audit, acceptance evidence, dependencies |
| ARCH | `docs/01_Technology_Architecture_Baseline.md`, Approved Architecture Baseline | Modular Monolith structure, Angular/.NET/SQL boundaries, API, authentication, jobs, files, telemetry, and testing enablers |
| WF-01 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Overview & Catalogue.dc.html` | Platform Overview and Tenant Catalogue, states, filters, pagination, EN/AR presentation |
| WF-02 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Provisioning.dc.html` | Create Tenant wizard, validation, progress, retry, and provisioning operations |
| WF-03 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Tenant Workspace & Lifecycle.dc.html` | Tenant Workspace, lifecycle, suspension, reactivation, and high-risk isolation |
| WF-04 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Plans, Entitlements & Modules.dc.html` | Plan, Subscription, Entitlement, module activation, limits, and branding screens |
| WF-05 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Support & Audit.dc.html` | Support authorization, active-session monitor, and Platform Audit |
| WF-06 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Offboarding & Purge.dc.html` | Export, offboarding, legal hold, purge review, cooling-off, and certificate |
| WF-07 | `wireframes/Wireframes - Layout Alternatives.dc.html` | Recommended Tenant Workspace spine (Alternative B) and high-risk action isolation |

### Decomposition rules

- The BRD is the authority for behavior. A wireframe contributes interaction evidence and screen coverage; it does not approve new business rules.
- No value shown as illustrative in a wireframe becomes a production default. This includes sample limits, support duration, export expiry, cooling-off duration, retention periods, backup cycles, tenant counts, and dates.
- MESP-48 remains the owner of reference volumes and supported-volume validation. MESP-50 remains the owner of residency, retention, legal hold, support-access duration, subprocessors, backup treatment, purge timing, and production offboarding policy.
- Identity and Access, Multi-Tenancy, and Organization details remain dependencies on MESP-28, MESP-29, and MESP-30. Their behavior is not redefined here.
- No story introduces Retail POS, finance posting, procurement, inventory execution, B2B Sales behavior, or a tenant's ERP workspace.
- No story is a subtask. The identifiers below are proposal identifiers only and are not Jira keys.

## 2. Proposed implementation Epic

### EPIC-PROPOSED-MESP27 — SaaS Platform Administration Wave 1

**Proposed issue type:** Epic (not created)

**Epic outcome:** A Platform Administrator can operate the approved SaaS administration surface for a Tenant from controlled onboarding through lifecycle management, Plan/Entitlement visibility, support authorization, audit evidence, export, and governed offboarding, with strict tenant isolation and no hidden high-risk shortcuts.

**In-scope capability groups:**

- Platform shell, overview, Tenant Catalogue, and Tenant Workspace.
- Controlled Tenant onboarding, duplicate review, provisioning progress, safe retry, and handover.
- One production Release 1 Plan, Subscription history, Entitlement visibility, module readiness, configurable usage visibility, and branding/document identity.
- Lifecycle transitions, suspension/reactivation, support access, Platform Audit, export/offboarding, purge review, and truthful purge certification.
- Arabic/English presentation, RTL behavior, accessibility signals, auditability, correlation, and critical-flow validation.

**Explicitly excluded from the Epic:**

- MESP-28 Identity and Access implementation, except for the minimum contract/seam required to enforce Platform/Tenant authorization.
- Detailed MESP-29 Multi-Tenancy, MESP-30 Organization, Finance, Procurement, Inventory, B2B Sales, Saudi compliance, migration, and external integration behavior.
- Retail POS, trials, automated subscription invoicing, metered billing, pricing-engine behavior, entitlement overrides, microservices, Kubernetes, and database-per-tenant infrastructure.

**Epic completion evidence:**

1. Every included story has BRD and/or approved wireframe traceability.
2. Platform-owned metadata and Tenant-owned data remain separated.
3. Cross-Tenant Platform registers are denied to Tenant actors.
4. High-risk lifecycle, support, export, and purge actions are authorized, audited, and reversible where the BRD permits.
5. Critical browser/API journeys and backend invariants pass through the approved xUnit and Playwright validation approach.
6. Open MESP-48 and MESP-50 decisions are not silently converted into implementation defaults.

## 3. Minimum technical enablers

These are the smallest technical foundations needed to implement the stories safely. They are proposed backlog records, not Jira subtasks.

| ID | Proposed enabler | Minimum outcome / acceptance evidence | Dependencies | Sprint 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TE-01 | Modular Monolith solution and module seam | The approved backend/frontend structure exists conceptually with a Platform Administration boundary, explicit contracts, and no direct cross-module table mutation. Architecture tests are planned for forbidden references. | ARCH §§4–6; later implementation entry gate | Yes |
| TE-02 | Shared SQL persistence and tenant-context guard | EF Core 10/SQL Server 2025 persistence conventions, module-owned schema ownership, trusted Tenant context, deny-by-default query/command guard, and isolation test fixture are defined. Database-per-tenant and per-Tenant schemas are not introduced. | ARCH §§4, 7; MESP-29; BRD M27-REQ-001/004, RULE-001/002 | Yes |
| TE-03 | Authentication and authorization seam | ASP.NET Core Identity, secure HTTP-only first-party cookie session, policy evaluation seam, Platform actor versus Tenant actor scope, and separate export authorization checkpoints are represented without implementing MESP-28 behavior. | ARCH §2; MESP-28; BRD M27-REQ-045–049, 071–073, 095 | Yes |
| TE-04 | REST/OpenAPI, error, correlation, and idempotency foundation | Versioned API contract conventions, safe validation/error envelope, stable request/correlation identity, optimistic concurrency approach, and idempotent command shape support provisioning, export, lifecycle, and audit flows. | ARCH §§2, 5; BRD M27-REQ-010/011/026/065/080 | Yes |
| TE-05 | Durable work, notification, and private-file adapters | SQL-backed work records/hosted-worker seam, retryable notifications, private object-storage adapter, export artifact metadata, expiry, and checksum/integrity fields are defined. No broker or search cluster is added. | ARCH §§1–3; MESP-50; BRD M27-REQ-059/063/076 | No — needed before async stories |
| TE-06 | Immutable audit and OpenTelemetry evidence | Common audit event contract, actor/Tenant/scope/correlation fields, authorized audit retrieval/export, structured logs, metrics, traces, freshness/data-as-of fields, and high-risk event taxonomy are defined. | ARCH §§2–3; MESP-38; BRD M27-REQ-007/074/075/078 | Yes |
| TE-07 | Angular Wave 1 shell, component, and RTL baseline | Angular 22 standalone feature-route shell follows WF-07 Alternative B: Catalogue → tabbed Tenant Workspace; status uses icon/text, high-risk actions are isolated, EN/AR direction and LTR-embedded identifiers are supported, and accessibility-safe defaults exist. | ARCH §6; WF-01/WF-03/WF-07; BRD M27-REQ-081/082 | Yes |
| TE-08 | Local and critical-flow test harness | Docker Compose local dependency profile, xUnit unit/integration/architecture test conventions, Playwright TypeScript browser/API fixtures, and a Restricted Validation Plan fixture for entitlement-denial tests are defined. | ARCH §§1–2, 8; MESP-48; BRD AC-009/041/042 | Yes |

**Enabler guardrail:** TE-03 must not become an unapproved replacement for MESP-28. It supplies only the contract needed by this Epic; session lifetime, MFA, access-scope detail, and full Identity behavior remain MESP-28/MESP-38 decisions.

## 4. Sequenced user stories

The sequence is dependency order, not an estimate. No story points, dates, capacity, assignee, or sprint commitment are invented.

### US-01 — Platform Overview and exception navigation

**User story:** As an authorized Platform Administrator, I want a Platform Overview that links every operational figure to its bounded register or workspace so that I can act on exceptions without relying on static vanity metrics.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Overview cards link to the relevant Tenant Catalogue, provisioning operations, lifecycle, support-session, limits, export/offboarding, purge, or audit view.
- Each card exposes scope, data-as-of/freshness, and an authorized drill-through; stale or asynchronously prepared data is visible as such.
- Platform/Tenant authorization is enforced server-side; Auditor and Support Operator views are read-only and scoped.
- Empty, loading, error, no-results, and restricted states are usable and do not reveal cross-Tenant information.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-010/078/079; WF-01 Screen 1.

**Not included:** Invented KPI thresholds, production volume promises, or downstream ERP module dashboards.

### US-02 — Tenant Catalogue with bounded views and states

**User story:** As an authorized Platform actor, I want to search and filter the Tenant Catalogue so that I can locate a Tenant and open its governed workspace without unsafe row-level high-risk actions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Search/filter supports the wireframe fields: Tenant identity/code, lifecycle, country, Plan, risk, and saved views where the owning contract permits.
- The catalogue shows stable identity, bilingual name, country, legal-entity count, Plan, Subscription, module status, usage, last activity, provisioning state, risk, and an Open action.
- Large results paginate server-side and never truncate silently; no sample count becomes a production assumption.
- Suspend and Purge are not row actions; they are reached through the Tenant Workspace and governed confirmation flows.
- Restricted users receive a safe denial and no cross-Tenant register data.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-001/004/010/067/070–072/097; WF-01 Screen 2.

**Dependencies:** TE-02/03/04/06/07; MESP-29 isolation contract.

### US-03 — Tenant Workspace read-only spine

**User story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want one Tenant Workspace with explicit tabs so that ordinary Tenant review is separated from high-risk lifecycle actions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Opening a catalogue row lands on a Tenant-scoped Workspace showing bilingual identity, stable code, lifecycle, country, legal-entity count, Plan, active-module summary, and recent activity.
- The tab structure follows the approved spine: Overview, Lifecycle, Companies, Plan & Subscription, Entitlements & Modules, Limits & Usage, Branding, Support Access, Exports, Offboarding, and Audit.
- The Platform view does not expose Procurement, Inventory, Finance, or other Tenant ERP navigation.
- Lifecycle high-risk actions are reached from the Lifecycle tab, not from a catalogue row.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-004/010/078; WF-03 Screen 5; WF-07 Alternative B.

**Dependencies:** TE-02/03/06/07; MESP-29 and MESP-30 contracts.

### US-04 — Create Tenant draft wizard

**User story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want to save and review a Tenant onboarding draft so that all required identity, locale, organization, administrator, Plan, limits, branding, and hosting inputs are captured before provisioning.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- The wizard captures the BRD-required input categories: Tenant code and identity, bilingual names/contact, country/locale, initial Company/Legal Entity, initial administrator, Plan/Subscription/modules/limits, branding/templates/numbering, contracted hosting region, cross-border support terms, and subprocessor restrictions.
- The current wireframe’s seven-step grouping is treated as review-friendly provisional grouping; steps may be regrouped without inventing or dropping required fields.
- There is no Trial option, no entitlement-override control, and no production assignment of the Restricted Validation Plan.
- Field-level validation state is visible; draft save/cancel/back/edit behavior preserves safe input.
- MESP-50-controlled fields cannot be activated with unresolved or contradictory production policy values.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-003/009/024/030/093/094; MESP-52; WF-02 Screen 3.

**Dependencies:** TE-02/03/04/07; MESP-29, MESP-30, MESP-37, and MESP-50. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-05 — Duplicate, completeness, and review gate

**User story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want possible duplicates and missing prerequisites surfaced before submission so that the Platform never silently creates or rejects the wrong Tenant.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Tenant code and legal/customer identity are checked before authoritative creation.
- Validation distinguishes unique, confirmed duplicate, and possible match requiring authorized review.
- The Review & Confirm view links each summary section back to its source step and blocks submission when mandatory controls fail.
- The review records the input snapshot, validation results, owner, and decision evidence.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-025/029/069/070; AC-004; WF-02 Screen 3.

**Dependencies:** US-04; TE-02/04/06; duplicate rules from MESP-29/30.

### US-06 — Idempotent provisioning run and operations

**User story:** As a Platform Operations owner, I want provisioning progress, success, failure, and retry states to be visible so that a failed run can resume safely without duplicate Tenants or usable partial access.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A submission creates one stable request/correlation identity and visible stage timeline.
- Stages expose Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Skipped, or Compensated with owner, blocker, completed stages, safe retry point, and user-safe message.
- Retry uses the same request identity and cannot create a second Tenant, invitation, Entitlement, or authoritative run.
- Partial provisioning cannot produce Active state, a usable invitation, operational module use, or a false success state.
- Success reaches Ready for Activation with a handover/readiness checklist and zero operational transactions.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-026–029/065/066/076/080; AC-001–003; WF-02 Screens 3–4.

**Dependencies:** US-05; TE-04/05/06; MESP-29/30/37 contracts.

### US-07 — Plan Catalogue and version history

**User story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want to view Plan versions and their effective metadata so that the one production Release 1 Plan and non-production Restricted Validation Plan remain distinguishable and auditable.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- The catalogue distinguishes one production Release 1 Plan from the non-production Restricted Validation Plan and never labels the latter as Trial.
- Each Plan version displays status, effective interval, included modules/features, configurable limits, service/support tier, non-calculating price metadata, environment eligibility, owner, and approval evidence.
- Historical versions remain visible and immutable after use; no screen calculates a charge or creates a subscription invoice, payment, or accounting transaction.
- Retail POS is absent and cannot be assigned.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-016/019/023; MESP-52; WF-04 Screen 7.

**Dependencies:** TE-02/03/04/06; MESP-52 already approved. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-08 — Subscription change preview and effective dating

**User story:** As an authorized Platform/Commercial actor, I want a reviewed preview of a Subscription change so that current Entitlements remain unchanged until the approved effective time.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Current and scheduled Plan/Subscription records show Tenant, Plan version, status, effective dates, reason, assigner/approver, and history.
- A change is previewed before save, including the expected limit/module impact and effective time.
- Current Entitlements remain unchanged before the effective time; historical evidence is not rewritten.
- A change cannot be represented as a direct per-Tenant Entitlement override.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-017/018/092; RULE-004/005/007; AC-005/006; WF-04 Screen 7.

**Dependencies:** US-07; TE-03/04/06; MESP-52.

### US-09 — Entitlement visibility and denial proof

**User story:** As an authorized Platform or Tenant administrator, I want to see the source, effective interval, dependency, restriction, and audit of each Entitlement so that commercial availability is not confused with user Permission.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Entitlement view shows capability/module, status, effective/expiry interval, source Plan/Subscription, dependency, temporary restriction, and audit link.
- A User with Permission but no effective Entitlement is denied; an Entitlement without User Permission is also denied.
- Security or operational-safety restriction can block an effective Entitlement but never grant one.
- No override control, hidden action, import, job, or integration path can grant a missing Entitlement.
- Restricted Validation Plan denial evidence is executable only in non-production.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-020–024/092; RULE-006/007; AC-007–010/042; WF-04 Screen 8.

**Dependencies:** US-08; TE-02/03/06/08; MESP-28/MESP-29 authorization contracts.

### US-10 — Module readiness, dependency block, and rollback evidence

**User story:** As a Platform Administrator, I want a module activation checklist with explicit dependency and rollback evidence so that a module cannot become partially usable or unsafe.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Checklist shows effective Entitlement, dependencies, configuration readiness, master/opening-data readiness, rollback-plan approval, owner, and activation approval.
- A failed dependency identifies the blocking module/configuration and prevents partial business use.
- Activation is allowed only for Active Tenant + effective Entitlement + ready dependencies/configuration/evidence + approved rollback plan + authorized approval.
- Read-Only and Deactivation Pending are shown as words and preserve data and required access.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-031–035; RULE-008/009; AC-011–014; WF-04 Module Activation.

**Dependencies:** US-09; TE-02/03/06; MESP-30 and later domain readiness contracts. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-11 — Limits and Usage visibility

**User story:** As an authorized administrator, I want fresh usage and limit status so that warnings are actionable and hard limits affect only the capacity-increasing action.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Each measure shows scope, unit, current value, source Plan value, measurement time, freshness, and status.
- Warning status notifies authorized administrators without blocking the triggering action.
- Hard-limit status names the blocked capacity-increasing action, preserves existing data/read access, and provides escalation.
- Unknown/stale values do not become invoiceable amounts or invented production thresholds.
- Final thresholds and supported-volume claims remain blocked on MESP-48 evidence.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-036–041; AC-015–017; WF-04 Screen 9.

**Dependencies:** US-07/08; TE-05/06; MESP-48. Illustrative wireframe values are not implementation defaults.

### US-12 — Feature cohort rollout and rollback

**User story:** As a Product or Operations owner, I want a controlled cohort rollout for an already-approved capability so that exposure can be limited, reversed, and reconstructed without bypassing Entitlements or authorization.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A rollout record captures the approved capability, owner, eligible Entitlement, environment, Tenant/cohort scope, start time, success criteria, rollback trigger, and expiry/removal decision.
- Cohort selection is explicit and reviewable; the rollout cannot add scope, grant Permission, bypass an Entitlement, alter posted history, or enable Retail POS.
- Rollback stops new exposure while preserving the interpretation of existing data and the affected Tenant/activity history.
- Expired rollout flags are surfaced for review and are removed or renewed only through an authorized decision; every change is audited.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-050–053; AC-024/025; WF-01 Overview exception/feature visibility and WF-03 Workspace activity evidence. The BRD is the behavior authority; no dedicated rollout screen is inferred from the wireframes.

**Dependencies:** TE-03/04/06/07; an approved capability and Entitlement contract; MESP-28/MESP-38 for final actor scope. No MESP-28 Identity behavior is introduced. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-13 — Branding, templates, numbering, and document identity

**User story:** As an authorized Tenant administrator, I want governed bilingual branding and document identity previews so that identity can be configured without changing authorization, tax meaning, audit, or numbering history.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- English/Arabic names, approved logo, accessible colors, contact details, document-template profile, and numbering profile can be reviewed with preview and validation evidence.
- Configuration records owner, Tenant/Company/document scope, Country Pack compatibility, version, effective interval, and history.
- Historical documents retain the template/number interpretation used; issued numbers are never silently changed or reused.
- Missing/rejected branding falls back to approved Platform defaults and does not disguise Platform/security identity.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-042–044/094; AC-022/023; WF-04 Screen 10.

**Dependencies:** TE-02/03/06/07; MESP-30 and MESP-37 contracts. Keep out of Sprint 1 except shell defaults.

### US-14 — Lifecycle workspace and suspension confirmation

**User story:** As an authorized Platform Administrator, I want lifecycle transitions isolated in the Tenant Workspace so that suspension effects are explicit, reviewable, and auditable.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Lifecycle view shows canonical state, allowed next transitions, blocked reason, history, actor, effective time, and evidence.
- Suspension captures type, scope, reason, authority, effective time, Grace Period decision, access mode, jobs/integrations behavior, notification, review date, and reactivation criteria.
- High-risk confirmation requires typed Tenant-specific confirmation and an exhaustive effect preview; it is not a single default-focused action.
- Security/legal suspension may bypass Grace Period only with the bypass reason recorded.
- Suspended state consistently enforces interactive and non-interactive restrictions without deleting data.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-012/013/054–056; RULE-012/028; AC-018–020/038; WF-03 Screens 5–6.

**Dependencies:** US-03; TE-03/04/06; MESP-28/29 and unresolved suspension-policy confirmations. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-15 — Reactivation and interrupted-work review

**User story:** As an authorized Platform Administrator, I want reactivation checks and deliberate interrupted-work review so that access is restored only after the suspension reason and dependent work are safe.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Security, Subscription, Entitlement, module-readiness, failed-job, and integration checks are visible.
- Reactivation remains disabled while any required check or acknowledgment is outstanding.
- Interrupted jobs/actions are reviewed and deliberately restarted; none is assumed complete or silently discarded.
- Reactivation closes/supersedes the reason, reevaluates access, and notifies owners of restored and still-restricted capabilities.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-057/058; AC-021; WF-03 Screen 6.

**Dependencies:** US-14; TE-04/05/06; MESP-28/29 and policy decision for read-only/suspension behavior.

### US-16 — Support authorization and active-session monitor

**User story:** As a Security/Support owner, I want named, time-boxed support authorization and an active-session monitor so that support is least-privilege, visible, revocable, and export-blind unless separately authorized.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Request captures case, Tenant, named user, purpose, scope, sensitivity, start/end, Tenant authorization, Platform approval, and separate export authorization state.
- A support session has a distinct case-labelled banner, one Tenant/scope, automatic expiry, immediate termination, and complete activity evidence.
- Downloads/exports remain blocked at zero unless separate export Permission, export authorization, and explicit Tenant authorization for the named artifact exist.
- Expiring sessions are flagged before lapse; cross-Tenant targeting is denied without revealing the target Tenant.
- Emergency access is not implemented or inferred; it remains separately governed by future approved policy.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-045–049/095; AC-026–029; WF-05 Screens 11–12.

**Dependencies:** TE-03/06; MESP-28, MESP-38, and MESP-50 maximum-duration/policy decisions. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-17 — Platform Audit dashboard and authorized evidence export

**User story:** As an Auditor or authorized Platform actor, I want a searchable Platform Audit view with data freshness and authorized evidence export so that material actions and denied attempts can be reconstructed without exposing other Tenants.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Filters include actor, Tenant, action type, risk level, date range, and saved views only within authorization.
- Rows expose trusted time, actor, Tenant/scope, action, object, result, risk, correlation, and drill-down evidence; data-as-of/freshness is visible.
- Denied cross-Tenant attempts are recorded without confirming the targeted Tenant to the unauthorized actor.
- Audit evidence export has its own authorization and is itself audited; Auditor view is read-only.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-074/075/078/084; AC-028/038; WF-05 Screen 13.

**Dependencies:** TE-03/04/06; US-14/16; MESP-38. Keep out of Sprint 1 except the audit foundation and read-only shell contract.

### US-18 — Export and offboarding disposition

**User story:** As an authorized Platform/Privacy actor, I want a bounded export and offboarding review so that termination cannot proceed without a known export disposition, integrity evidence, legal-hold review, and visible waiver risk.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Export records scope, categories, formats, identifiers/relationships, exclusions, data-as-of, requester/approver, artifact, integrity evidence, expiry, download authorization, and downloads.
- Export generation/download is asynchronous or stateful where required, retryable, bounded, and independently authorized.
- A support identity cannot reach export authorization through support scope alone.
- Waiver is explicit and warns when no accepted/recoverable Tenant copy may remain before purge; expired artifacts are inaccessible.
- Termination requires export disposition, open matter review, legal-hold check, Subscription end, access closure plan, and responsible approval.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-059–061/065/067/068/076/077; AC-029–031; WF-06 Screen 14.

**Dependencies:** TE-03/04/05/06; MESP-50 export/retention policy. Keep out of Sprint 1.

### US-19 — Purge review, cooling-off, and truthful certificate

**User story:** As a Security/Privacy owner, I want purge approval and certificate evidence bounded to a certified scope so that irreversible operations have dual control, a cooling-off/final-notice gate, and truthful residual-copy disclosure.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Active legal hold is a hard stop for approval and execution; no override control is exposed.
- Purge approval requires dual control, retention expiry, exact Tenant/certified-scope confirmation, backup treatment, recovery plan, MESP-50-controlled cooling-off interval, final notice, and recheck before execution.
- Execution is blocked until the interval and final notice are complete; approval can be revoked before execution.
- Certificate states certified scope, included/excluded systems/data, residual backups/retained copies, legal-hold/retention restrictions, and whether restoration remains possible outside scope.
- Universal restoration impossibility is never claimed unless all residual copies are demonstrably removed; partial failure is not certified complete.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-062–064/096; AC-032–035; WF-06 Screens 15–16.

**Dependencies:** TE-04/05/06; MESP-50 and qualified privacy/legal/security validation. Last in sequence; excluded from Sprint 1.

### US-20 — EN/AR localization and RTL completion across Wave 1

**User story:** As an English- or Arabic-speaking Platform actor, I want the Wave 1 administration surface to preserve meaning and authority when language and direction change so that RTL is operationally equivalent to LTR.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- All Wave 1 screens provide approved EN/AR labels, validation, warnings, irreversible consequences, and fallback behavior.
- Layout, navigation, tables, drawers, steppers, icons, and state markers mirror as blocks; codes, emails, identifiers, dates, and digit groups remain correctly embedded LTR where required.
- Status is not conveyed by color alone; Read-Only, Warning, Hard Limit, Restricted, and high-risk states use text/icon cues.
- Language/direction changes do not alter authority, scope, state, values, effective times, or evidence.

**Trace:** BRD M27-REQ-077/081/082; AC-036/037; WF-01–WF-06 mirrored screens; WF-07 recommendation.

**Dependencies:** TE-07/08; approved glossary terminology and MESP-37 localization rules. Sprint 1 covers the shell/catalogue slice only; full completion is an Epic exit criterion.

## 4B. Mandatory self-review pass 2 — story quality

Estimates are provisional sizing for decomposition only; they are not Jira commitments. Every Story is at or below 8, has one demonstrable outcome, has testable acceptance criteria, identifies blocking dependencies, and names an approved BRD/wireframe design reference.

| Story | Estimate | One outcome and workflow purity | Independent demonstration | Acceptance criteria testability | Later-BRD / scope guard | Dependencies and design reference | Sequence | Result |

**Pass 2 split decision:** US-12 was added as a separate Story because Feature Rollout (§18 and AC-024/025) was not represented by a dedicated Story. The remaining Stories each retain one cohesive workflow outcome, have an estimate of 8 or below, and pass all checks above; no further split is required.

## 4C. Mandatory self-review pass 3 — scope protection

The following terms may appear in the backlog only as explicit exclusions, safety guards, dependencies, or deferred decisions. They are not deliverables.

| Protected scope item | Review result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Retail POS | Pass — excluded from the Epic and guarded in US-07/US-12; no implementation item enables it | Document control, decomposition rules, US-07, US-12, Sprint 1 deferrals |
| Procurement transactions | Pass — no transaction workflow or story | US-03/US-10 scope guards and Epic boundary |
| Inventory transactions | Pass — no transaction workflow or story | US-03/US-10 scope guards and Epic boundary |
| Finance transactions | Pass — no posting, billing, payment, invoice, or accounting workflow | US-07 and Epic boundary |
| B2B Sales transactions | Pass — Release 1 is platform administration only | Document control, Epic boundary, US-03 |
| Production billing automation | Pass — explicitly prohibited | US-07 acceptance criteria and Epic exclusions |
| Per-Tenant Entitlement overrides | Pass — explicitly prohibited and tested as denial | US-08/US-09 and MESP-52 trace |
| Production physical purge execution in Sprint 1 | Pass — US-19 is last and explicitly deferred; Sprint 1 is read-only | US-19; Sprint 1 scope and deferrals |
| Final MESP-28 Identity behavior | Pass — TE-03 is contract-only; final behavior remains a dependency | TE-03, DEP-01, US-12/US-16 |
| Invented MESP-48 volume limits | Pass — no threshold or capacity promise is assigned | TE-08, DEP-03, US-11 |
| Invented MESP-50 retention or purge durations | Pass — policy values remain unresolved and owned by MESP-50 | DEP-04, US-04/16/18/19 |
| Jira writes | Pass — no Jira issue, comment, or Sprint is created | Document control and §7 readiness gates |
| Source-code changes | Pass — this is a backlog artifact only | Document control and task boundary |
| Parallel execution recommendations | Pass — only dependency-ordered sequencing is proposed; no parallel work recommendation appears | §4 sequence and Sprint 1 candidate scope |

## 5. Dependency and uncertainty register

| ID | Dependency / uncertainty | Effect on backlog | Safe handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-01 | MESP-28 Identity and Access details (session, MFA, scope, membership, permissions) | Blocks production-grade authorization implementation and support identity behavior | Implement TE-03 contract only; keep affected stories out of Sprint 1 except contract tests |
| DEP-02 | MESP-29 Multi-Tenancy lifecycle/isolation and MESP-30 Organization/legal-entity rules | Affects provisioning inputs, Tenant Workspace Companies tab, activation dependencies, and isolation | Use BRD-approved boundary and stable contracts; do not invent organization workflows |
| DEP-03 | MESP-48 reference volumes and supported limits | Blocks production thresholds, capacity promises, and final Limits & Usage values | Treat wireframe values as illustrative; keep US-11 after evidence |
| DEP-04 | MESP-50 residency/hosting, cross-border support, subprocessors, retention, legal hold, support duration, backup treatment, export expiry, and purge timing | Blocks production provisioning/offboarding/purge policy | Capture fields and pending states; do not activate unresolved production policy |
| DEP-05 | MESP-37 Saudi Country Pack and document/numbering rules | Affects locale defaults, statutory document identity, templates, and numbering | Use explicit configuration contracts; defer detailed compliance behavior |
| DEP-06 | Wireframes are schematic and the seven wizard steps are provisional | Exact component behavior and grouping may change | Preserve required fields and invariants; refine visual/component detail during implementation design without changing BRD behavior |
| DEP-07 | MESP-19 traceability and Jira recording are not yet updated for this proposed backlog | Jira references are not evidence of creation or approval | Keep this artifact local; record Jira only after Hossam approves the backlog and the required Jira workflow is authorized |

## 6. Proposed Development Sprint 1

### Sprint proposal

**Sprint name:** Proposed Sprint 1 — Platform Read-Only Vertical Slice

**Sprint goal:** Prove a tenant-isolated, authorized, bilingual Platform shell → Overview → Tenant Catalogue → Tenant Workspace read-only journey, with auditable API calls and denial behavior, before onboarding or high-risk mutations are attempted.

**Duration/capacity:** Not specified in the approved sources. Confirm the team’s sprint length and one-developer capacity before scheduling. This is a scope proposal, not a Jira Sprint.

### Candidate Sprint 1 scope

| Include | Record | Sprint result |
|---|---|---|
| Technical enabler | TE-01 | Minimal Modular Monolith solution/module seam and architecture-test conventions |
| Technical enabler | TE-02 | Trusted Tenant context, Platform-owned metadata read boundary, and isolation fixture |
| Technical enabler | TE-03 | Platform/Tenant policy seam and secure first-party cookie contract; no MESP-28 implementation |
| Technical enabler | TE-04 | REST/OpenAPI, error, correlation, and read-request safety conventions |
| Technical enabler | TE-06 | Audit event contract, correlation propagation, and OpenTelemetry-compatible evidence seam |
| Technical enabler | TE-07 | Angular 22 shell, navigation, Workspace spine, EN/AR/RTL baseline, accessible state markers |
| Technical enabler | TE-08 | xUnit/Playwright fixtures, Docker Compose test dependencies, and cross-Tenant denial coverage |
| User story | US-01 | Overview cards are data-backed links with freshness and restricted/error states |
| User story | US-02 | Tenant Catalogue supports bounded search/filter/pagination and safe restricted state |
| User story | US-03 | Tenant Workspace opens the approved read-only tabbed spine without ERP module navigation |
| User story | US-20 (slice) | EN/AR/RTL behavior is proven for the shell, Overview, Catalogue, and Workspace slice |

### Sprint 1 exit evidence

- A Platform-authorized actor can open Overview, Catalogue, and a Tenant Workspace using server-enforced scope.
- A Tenant actor cannot read the cross-Tenant Platform register; denial does not reveal other Tenant existence or data.
- Overview figures link to bounded views and expose data-as-of/freshness; static vanity KPIs are not accepted.
- Catalogue has server-side pagination, approved filter categories, empty/loading/error/no-results/restricted states, and no Suspend/Purge row actions.
- Workspace shows bilingual identity, stable code, lifecycle, country, legal-entity count, Plan/module summary, recent activity, and the approved tab structure.
- EN/AR direction changes preserve authority, values, identifiers, state, and warning meaning; status is not color-only.
- xUnit covers tenant-isolation/authorization invariants and Playwright covers the critical browser/API read journey.
- Audit/correlation evidence exists for the read requests and denied cross-Tenant attempt.

### Explicitly deferred from Sprint 1

- Create Tenant wizard submission, provisioning execution, retries, invitations, and module activation.
- Plan/Subscription changes, Entitlement changes, Limits & Usage thresholds, branding writes, support authorization, audit export, export/offboarding, purge, and any high-risk lifecycle mutation.
- MESP-28 implementation, MESP-29/MESP-30 detailed behavior, MESP-48 threshold approval, MESP-50 production policy, all downstream ERP modules, and Retail POS.

## 7. Backlog readiness and approval gates

Before any Jira recording or implementation start:

1. Hossam approves this backlog proposal and confirms whether the proposed local issue hierarchy matches the Jira project’s available issue types.
2. MESP-27 BRD remains approved and its Founder Review approval evidence is recorded according to the existing workflow.
3. TE-03, DEP-01, and the boundary with MESP-28 are explicitly accepted as a contract-only seam.
4. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain visible as blockers for the affected later stories; no illustrative wireframe number is promoted to a production value.
5. The implementation team confirms Sprint 1 capacity and the definition of done; no sprint is created in Jira by this artifact.

## 8. Scope and quality check

- One proposed implementation Epic is defined.
- Eight minimum technical enablers are defined.
- Twenty sequenced User Stories are defined without subtasks; provisional decomposition estimates are recorded only in the mandatory quality table and are all 8 or below.
- One proposed Sprint 1 is defined and limited to a read-only, tenant-isolated vertical slice.
- Pass 1 — Coverage: **PASS**. Every approved MESP-27 section, requirement family, decision, and acceptance-scenario family maps to at least one enabler or Story; unresolved values retain a named owner.
- Pass 2 — Story quality: **PASS**. All twenty Stories deliver one demonstrable outcome, use testable acceptance criteria, have explicit dependencies and design references, remain within estimate 8, and are dependency-sequenced. US-12 was added to close the Feature Rollout gap.
- Pass 3 — Scope protection: **PASS**. No prohibited transaction scope, final MESP-28 behavior, invented MESP-48/MESP-50 values, Jira write, source-code change, production purge execution in Sprint 1, or parallel-execution recommendation is present as a deliverable.
- No application code, Jira issue, Jira comment, Jira Sprint, test-case document, MESP-28 implementation, downstream ERP module work, or Retail POS work was created.
- BRD NFRs, Trial exclusion, no-override rule, Restricted Validation Plan, support/export separation, purge truthfulness, multiple legal entities, and MESP-48/MESP-50 gates are preserved.
