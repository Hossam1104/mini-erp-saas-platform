# Mini ERP SaaS Platform — Project Statistics & Production Readiness Tracker

## MESP-144 reconciliation record - 30 August 2026 (HOLD 5 merge-safety)

- MESP-144 reconciliation reached Sol content acceptance at comment `12293` on
  reviewed head `ffe5a8975611dcc85c3a7c40dce0b3737b123aeb`. HOLD 5 merge-safety
  authority is comment `12296` and exists only to make repository state
  merge-safe. At the HOLD 5 executor handoff, Jira and PR lifecycle had not yet
  been finalized; Jira and GitHub remain authoritative for their respective
  final states.
- The pre-reconciliation main baseline was `4d6e33189a3835d5d8d2a58736055a837a3f5bc9`;
  the bounded branch is `chore/project-health-reconciliation-cleanup`.
- MESP-137 is **Done / accepted / merged**. No implementation capability is
  active; MESP-138 and MESP-139 remain To Do/inactive; MESP-9 remains In
  Progress; and MESP-48/MESP-50 remain open production gates.
- Fast-track remains **21/26 = 80.8%**. Production readiness remains
  approximately **47% overall / 41% Procurement/P2P**.
- This record changes repository documentation/state only. No product
  source, tests, migrations, assets, Jira state, or later capability changed.
  PR #82's lifecycle at handoff is a historical fact; GitHub remains
  authoritative for its final lifecycle.

## Progress history - 30 August 2026 (MESP-144 HOLD 5 merge-safety)

MESP-144 reconciliation reached Sol content acceptance at comment `12293` on
reviewed head `ffe5a8975611dcc85c3a7c40dce0b3737b123aeb`; HOLD 5 merge-safety
authority is comment `12296`. The cleanup preserves the accepted current-main
baseline without history rewrite. Fast-track and production-readiness figures
are unchanged at `21/26 = 80.8%` and approximately `47% overall / 41%
Procurement/P2P`; no implementation capability was added or activated.

All dated capability records below are historical unless they are part of an
explicitly current authoritative snapshot above.

## Current authoritative fast-track snapshot - 30 August 2026 (MESP-137 closed and merged; awaiting next Sol activation)

- MESP-132, MESP-133, MESP-134, MESP-135, MESP-136, and MESP-137 are **Done**
  and merged. MESP-136 accepted/merged on 2026-08-28T23:37:13Z at

  comment `12252`; closure MESP-136 comment `12255`, MESP-9 reconciliation
  `12256`). MESP-137 is squash-merged to `main` at
  `6b3aeb63da15253dee5466f7be001773b80c28ad`, from accepted feature head
  `9406e8c6408251323b96d4a0c25082142546b9ef`, via PR #84
  (closed/merged/non-Draft). Final Sol acceptance: MESP-137 comment `12282`;
  post-merge closure: comment `12284`; MESP-9 closure reconciliation:
  comment `12285`.
- MESP-137 delivered Sales-linked Inventory reservation/allocation, partial
  fulfillment, durable coordinated/reconcilable Delivery handoff,
  Finance-owned invoice eligibility/AR handoff seams, durable evidence, and
  the bilingual RTL Sales workspace. Returns, credit notes, receipts,
  refunds, revenue recognition, external integrations, ZATCA/FATOORA, and
  Wafra-specific behavior remain excluded.
- **No implementation capability is currently active.** MESP-138 and
  MESP-139 remain To Do/inactive, pending explicit GPT-5.6 Sol activation.
  MESP-9 remains In Progress pending further Sales/Order-to-Cash
  capabilities.
- **Fast-track capability completion is now 21/26 = 80.8%**, authoritative
  after MESP-137's verified merge and Jira Done closure; production
  readiness remains separate and unchanged at approximately **47% overall**
  and **41% Procurement/P2P**. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open production
  gates.
- Ponytail FULL is the default executor mode when available (Claude Code,
  OpenAI Codex). Machine-local plugin and cache state must not be committed
  to the repository.

## Jira/documentation synchronization - 30 August 2026 (MESP-137 closure)

- MESP-137 is Done. Sol final acceptance is MESP-137 comment `12282`;
  post-merge closure is comment `12284`; MESP-9 closure reconciliation is
  comment `12285`.
- The bounded capability covered reservation, partial fulfillment, delivery,
  and Finance-owned invoice eligibility/AR handoff. No MESP-138/MESP-139
  activation, next-capability implementation, or additional Jira write was
  performed by this reconciliation. MESP-48/MESP-50 remain open production
  gates.
- Fast-track is now 21/26 = 80.8%; production readiness remains ~47% overall
  / ~41% Procurement/P2P.
- This reconciliation is documentation/state only: zero product code, zero
  Jira writes, zero MESP-138/139 activation. It was prepared on branch
  `chore/MESP-137-closure-reconciliation` via PR #85; during its bounded
  executor handoff the PR was left Draft for independent GPT-5.6 Sol review.
  PR lifecycle state (Draft/Open/Merged) is not part of the enduring
  authoritative project state — GitHub remains authoritative for PR #85's
  current and final status.

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 30 August 2026 (MESP-137 HOLD-2 remediation complete — awaiting independent Sol acceptance; superseded by closure above)

- MESP-132, MESP-133, MESP-134, MESP-135, and MESP-136 are Done and merged.
  MESP-136 accepted/merged on 2026-08-28T23:37:13Z at `992195f7e61cf03b94675a498377a6d8bf679ebf`.
  Accepted feature head was `507bd1b11b933fd81d734e5cd12cad4c858dffb4`.
  Final Sol acceptance: MESP-136 comment `12252`. Closure: MESP-136 comment `12255`, MESP-9 reconciliation `12256`.
- MESP-137 was In Progress/activated under MESP-9 by MESP-137 comment `12265` and MESP-9 reconciliation `12266`, on branch `feat/MESP-137-reservation-fulfillment-invoice` from exact `origin/main` baseline `cb58d69fb0a589d363aed2d55b605e39f79d03bc`. HOLD-2 authority is MESP-137 comment `12275` with MESP-9 reconciliation `12277`. MESP-138 and MESP-139 remained To Do/inactive.
- `MESP-137 HOLD-2 remediation complete — awaiting independent Sol acceptance`. The bounded remediation continued Draft PR #84 from exact HOLD-1 head `4ecfb64ffd5391a934af80fe11003b9031881ae3`; pushed head is `d1914884bead08fac7a5b4eddc6f573297ef5550`.
- HOLD-137-E made serializable Sales invoice preparation authoritative for current Posted Deliveries, prior invoice evidence, source allocation, quantity, net/tax/gross residuals, tax identity, Payment Term, and source snapshot; Finance posts from persisted Sales evidence. HOLD-137-F persists real downstream fingerprints, known Inventory Movement IDs and Finance effect IDs, explicit committed/not-acknowledged/reconciliation-required semantics, durable retry identity, and fail-closed effect/provenance mismatch checks.
- Fast-track at the time of this snapshot was 20/26 = 76.9%; superseded by 21/26 = 80.8% above after Sol acceptance and merge.
- Validation was green: Release `0 warnings / 0 errors`; full disposable-LocalDB
  backend `1,138/1,138` with 0 failures and 0 skips; SQL safety `80/80`;
  focused Inventory ledger/stock-control/valuation `34/34`, `12/12`, `44/44`;
  focused Sales `38/38`; Finance MESP-135 `31/31`; REST foundation `36/36`;
  catalogue validation `4/4`; host security `19/19`; identity/authorization
  `89/89`; Angular `305/305` across 43 spec files; focused Chromium `2/2`;
  full Chromium `49/49`; both npm audits report `0 vulnerabilities`; and
  transitive NuGet vulnerability scanning is clear across all five discovered
  backend projects. All seven EF contexts report no pending model changes.
  Generated OpenAPI has `417` unique operationIds and the REST catalogue has
  `418` public / `2` internal operations. `git diff --check` is clean.
- Production initial bundle was `512.18 kB`, `12.18 kB` over the retained
  `500 kB` budget; Sales lazy chunk is `88.24 kB`. The warning was retained and
  the budget was not raised. Isolated runtime at that time: API
  `http://localhost:5310` PID `34956`, Angular `http://localhost:4300` PID
  `42444`, data `.runtime/hold2-runtime-20260830`; health, OpenAPI, Scalar,
  Angular, authentication/context, and authenticated Sales quotation/order
  reads were HTTP 200; no live reservation/delivery/invoice mutation was
  performed; port `5300` was not touched.

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 28 August 2026 (MESP-136 Sol HOLD 2)

- MESP-132, MESP-133, MESP-134, and MESP-135 are Done and merged. MESP-135's
  accepted feature head is `dbc239d6bd1ef948bb8505d4360208f4a3470dda`; PR #79

  final accounting closure comment `12200` and MESP-10 reconciliation `12201`.
- MESP-136 is the single active implementation capability under Epic MESP-9,
  both In Progress/activated under Sol evidence MESP-136 comment `12234` and
  MESP-9 reconciliation `12235`. HOLD 2 authority is MESP-136 comment `12244`
  with MESP-9 reconciliation `12245`. It is on
  `feat/MESP-136-b2b-quote-order-credit`, starting from reviewed head
  `36d1c04cb4537142bdb29d369d40e35ac3b76618` and exact main baseline
  `8bab7e36ca7fe4da0d8e62e7d7a4b9d7bcd59f6c`; source/test/UI commit is
  `397ef6d`; the final documentation/tracker handoff SHA follows after push.
- HOLD 2A makes Draft/ReturnedForChange to PendingApproval resolve the current
  effective policy at submission, persist that exact snapshot, and use it for
  pending stage/count/eligibility/SoD/cancellation and policy identity; live
  delegation remains time-bounded and is checked against the stored stage.
  HOLD 2B adds integrated SalesService credit acceptance through
  `TransitionOrderAsync` and `OverrideCreditAsync` using a controllable
  Finance-owned exposure fixture, covering eligible, overdue warning, limit,
  Finance hold, unavailable truth, valid and unauthorized/self/expired
  overrides, exposure/limit changes, material edit invalidation, and durable
  credit/history/audit evidence. The small Sales UI cleanup removes the
  duplicate Audit button and restores the Audit tab click handler.
- Validation is green: Release `0 warnings / 0 errors`; focused Sales `21/21`;
  full disposable-LocalDB backend `1,119/1,119` with 0 failures and 0 skips;
  SQL safety `80/80`; REST/OpenAPI/host/security `55/55`; generated OpenAPI
  `410` operationIds; catalog `411` public / `2` internal; Angular `305/305`
  across 43 spec files; focused Sales Chromium `2/2`; full Chromium `49/49`;
  EF pending-model check clean; both npm audits `0 vulnerabilities`; NuGet
  vulnerable-package scan clear; and final `git diff --check` clean. Production
  initial bundle is `510.08 kB`, `10.08 kB` over the 500 kB budget; Sales lazy
  chunk is `72.72 kB`. The warning is retained and the budget was not raised.
- Runtime is left running through the canonical launcher with loopback
  Development auth bypass: backend PID `44876` on `5300`, frontend PID
  `44908` on `4300`. Required health, OpenAPI, frontend, Finance smoke, Sales,
  and order-edit probes returned HTTP 200; `LEFT RUNNING = YES`.
- Fast-track capability completion remains **19/26 = 73.1%** until third Sol
  acceptance, verified merge, and Jira closure. Production readiness remains
  separate and unchanged at approximately **47% overall** and **41%
  Procurement/P2P**. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open production gates.
- MESP-137, MESP-138, and MESP-139 remain To Do/inactive. PR #80 is
  Open/Draft/Unmerged. No Jira writes, Opus review, Ready transition, merge,
  rebase, or force-push occurred; the presentation remains main-only and
  `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 28 August 2026 (MESP-136 Sol HOLD 1)

- MESP-132, MESP-133, MESP-134, and MESP-135 are Done and merged. MESP-135's
  accepted feature head is `dbc239d6bd1ef948bb8505d4360208f4a3470dda`; PR #79

  final accounting closure comment `12200` and MESP-10 reconciliation `12201`.
- MESP-136 is the single active implementation capability under Epic MESP-9,
  both In Progress/activated under Sol evidence MESP-136 comment `12234` and
  MESP-9 reconciliation `12235`; Sol HOLD 1 authority is MESP-136 comment
  `12239` with MESP-9 reconciliation `12240`. It is implemented on
  `feat/MESP-136-b2b-quote-order-credit` from exact baseline
  `8bab7e36ca7fe4da0d8e62e7d7a4b9d7bcd59f6c`; original reviewed head was
  `be62e0ff46ec9100584be623d18d203e880aa052`; remediation source/test commit
  is `a140237d564ccd90f409404bb861b3b7c96380c2`; the final
  documentation/tracker handoff SHA follows after the final push.
- The bounded capability adds reusable Tenant/Company/Branch-scoped B2B
  quotations and Sales Orders, server-authoritative Price List resolution,
  immutable commercial/tax/FX evidence, approval/delegation/SoD seams,
  Finance-exposed credit outcomes and controlled override, durable idempotency,
  revisions/history/audit, optimistic concurrency, and bilingual RTL Angular
  Sales workspace surfaces. HOLD 1A makes quotation/order Company/Branch scope
  immutable after creation. HOLD 1B adds durable configuration-led effective
  multi-stage approval state with required counts, delegation/SoD evidence,
  and revision binding. HOLD 1C wires actual runtime providers to
  `MESP_SALES_POLICIES` for approval, commercial authority, delegation, and
  Finance-owned credit limits with fail-closed missing configuration. HOLD 1D
  adds controlled Sales Order edit/revision, ReturnedForChange correction and
  resubmission, re-pricing, approval/credit invalidation, cancellation policy,
  audit, idempotency, and concurrency. No Wafra-specific behavior was added.
- Validation is green: Release `0 warnings / 0 errors`; focused Sales `16/16`;
  full disposable-LocalDB backend `1,114/1,114` with 0 failures and 0 skips;
  SQL safety `80/80`; REST/OpenAPI/host/security `59/59`; generated OpenAPI
  `410` operationIds and catalog `411` public / `2` internal; Angular `305/305`
  across 43 spec files; focused Sales Chromium `2/2`; full Chromium `49/49`;
  EF pending-model check clean; both npm audits `0 vulnerabilities`; NuGet
  vulnerable-package scan clear; and `git diff --check` clean. Production
  initial bundle is `510.08 kB`, exceeding the 500 kB budget by `10.08 kB`;
  Sales lazy chunk is `72.82 kB`. The warning is retained and the budget was
  not increased.
- Runtime is left running through the canonical launcher: backend PID `22504`
  on `5300`, frontend PID `48376` on `4300`. The 11 existing backend/root/
  Finance probes, three existing Sales probes, and the new order-edit route
  returned HTTP 200 (`15/15`).
- Fast-track capability completion remains **19/26 = 73.1%** until Sol
  acceptance, verified merge, and Jira closure. Production readiness remains
  separate and unchanged at approximately **47% overall** and **41%
  Procurement/P2P**. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open production gates.
- MESP-137, MESP-138, and MESP-139 remain To Do/inactive. No Jira writes were

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 27 August 2026 (MESP-135 Sol HOLD 6)

- MESP-135 remains the only active Finance implementation capability under
  MESP-10, with HOLD 6 authority MESP-135 `12186` and MESP-10 `12187`.
- The exact HOLD 6 feature start and remote head were
  `243199b22b1762f0797d19702577b874429dabaf`; the focused source/test commit
  is `69b20b3c0dbba2a7f3b6c5ade2a19f63ad7fb9bb`. The feature remains based on
  Finance merge-base `841a777af1622cb4de9c3708cd4a2b389b7ef9e9`; current
  `origin/main` `0d1485d4a2197f23250b1d5acc1a00ddf26dc4c9` differs only by the
  expected main-only presentation PPTX.
- Close readiness now consumes effective MESP-134 unrealized-FX reconciliation
  at the exact period-end as-of date. Valid reversed lines remain historical
  but inactive; replacement evidence must be the sole active reconciled line.
  Valid reversed evidence is allowed for current zero-effect sources, while
  unexpected active zero-effect evidence and missing, broken, duplicate, stale,
  extra, cross-Company, or cross-Tenant evidence block. Deterministic coverage
  fingerprinting includes effective active and unresolved evidence.
- HOLD 6 adds no public endpoint, entity, DbContext, schema, migration, or
  `frontend/assets` change. Fast-track remains `18/26 = 69.2%`; production
  readiness remains approximately `47%` overall and `41%` Procurement/P2P.
- Validation: Release `0/0`; focused MESP-133 `22/22`, MESP-134 `27/27`, and
  MESP-135 `31/31`; full disposable-LocalDB backend `1,098/1,098` passed with

| Current repository control | Verified position |
|---|---|
| Starting feature head | `a76481ab423ef9ffb102af352050974491d6f2b9` |
| Reconciled base | `841a777af1622cb4de9c3708cd4a2b389b7ef9e9` |
| Implementation head | `502490c25cc28beafef1a0b047a5fff7c7221a9c` (`fix(MESP-135): bind revaluation readiness to historical as-of effectiveness`); final branch tip follows with documentation-only synchronization |
| Current capability | MESP-135 Finance close, corrections, reconciliation and core reports; In Progress under MESP-10; HOLD 4 bounded remediation complete on the same branch/PR |
| Branch / PR | `feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`; Draft PR #79 remains Open/Draft/Unmerged for Sol re-review |
| HOLD 4 closure | The `revaluation_policy` close-readiness gate no longer reads current `FinanceRevaluationBatchEntity.Status`. It now reuses the MESP-134 authority already computed at the same AsOfDate — `ReconcileUnrealizedFxAsync(context, companyId, period.EndDate, ct)` — and requires a period-end revaluation line reported `FinanceEvidenceStatus.Reconciled` at that date, so effectiveness follows durable original/reversal journal chronology and a later reversal cannot rewrite a closed period. |
| Fail-closed behaviour | Reversal effective on/before period end reports `Reversed` and blocks; missing or broken lineage reports `PendingMapping` and blocks; `unrealized_fx_reconciliation` and `revaluation_policy` read one result at one AsOfDate and cannot disagree; no second revaluation engine was introduced |
| Regressions added | `Revaluation_readiness_is_satisfied_by_a_period_end_revaluation_effective_at_period_end`; `Revaluation_readiness_at_period_end_is_unchanged_by_a_revaluation_reversal_posted_after_period_end`; `Revaluation_readiness_is_blocked_when_the_revaluation_reversal_is_effective_by_period_end`; `Revaluation_readiness_snapshot_at_period_end_is_stable_across_a_later_revaluation_reversal` — all against real production persistence and genuine `ReverseJournalAsync` reversals |
| Validation | Release 0 warnings/0 errors; focused MESP-133 settlement `22/22`, MESP-134 `27/27`, MESP-135 `20/20`; full backend `1,087/1,087` passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1,083 baseline + exactly 4 new); complete SQL safety `80/80` including `Close04`, `Year03`, and `Corr03`; REST/OpenAPI/host `55/55` |

## Historical progress history addendum - 27 August 2026

HOLD 6 is a bounded correctness remediation inside the already-counted
MESP-135 capability. It adds no new capability, no new public operation, and
no schema or migration change, so accepted fast-track completion remains
`18/26 = 69.2%` and production readiness remains approximately `47%` overall
and `41%` Procurement/P2P. Backend test depth moved from `1,092` to `1,098`
executed cases through six production-persistence coverage regressions; the
existing later-reversal snapshot regression was also strengthened with direct
MESP-134 evidence assertions.

| Residual disclosed limitation | AP/AR subledger reconciliation (`FinanceSettlementPersistence.GetReconciliationAsync`) remains current-state-only and is not yet threaded with an `asOfDate` overload; Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet do not yet have dedicated CSV export endpoints (no catalog metadata exists for them) — both are out of this bounded HOLD 1 fix and must be scoped as explicit follow-up work, not silently expanded into this remediation. |

### Historical MESP-133 acceptance snapshot - 25 August 2026

MESP-133 extended the accepted settlement spine. The real
`ProcurementFinanceSupplierInvoiceSourceProvider`
is directly exercised with bounded fakes for authoritative handoff, match,
Company, Purchase Order, Payment Term, and Supplier persistence. The four
provider tests prove active source readiness, missing/inactive/cross-Tenant
exclusion, no CreatedAt commercial-date fabrication, and unsupported
ReceiptDate/DeliveryDate fail-closed behavior. The new Finance persistence test
proves non-overlapping recognition Posting Rule A (February → AP Control A) and
B (May → AP Control B) from actual journal lines, with truthful reconciliation
and no PendingMapping. The existing historical allocation/reversal test remains
retained. MESP-133 HOLD 3 adds authoritative Supplier existence, Tenant, Active-lifecycle,
candidate-Company, and handoff-identity validation to AP source readiness;
trusted AP dates are the Supplier Invoice Date/document date only, with no
CreatedAt fallback. It also closes the AP payment-term/due-date path from
trusted MESP-126/Procurement evidence, reuses the MESP-132 approval policy,
enforces manual-only methods, binds cash/bank settlement posting to the
selected linked GL account, reconciles actual subledger and journal movement,
applies accounting-date as-of semantics, and makes route/document direction
and rejected correction behavior coherent. Manual AR and settlements use
config-led MESP-120 Exchange Rate selection and exact document-date reference
evidence; functional-currency transactions carry no FX evidence. Realized FX
and external providers remain outside scope and fail closed. The additive migration remains
`20260824220208_MESP133ApArCashSettlement`.

## Historical MESP-134 implementation result - 26 August 2026

MESP-134 HOLD 2 is implemented on the single bounded feature branch as the Finance
tax, monetary-policy, Reporting Currency, realized-FX, and period-end
revaluation capability. It consumes the existing MESP-119 Tax and MESP-120
Currency/Exchange Rate authorities, preserves exact transaction/functional/
Reporting evidence and rounding, reclassifies tax through configured Finance
Posting Rules, removes the bounded realized-FX settlement limitation using
historical AP/AR and actual posted settlement lineage, and provides Draft →
Calculated → Posted → Reversed revaluation batches for eligible foreign AP,
AR, and unallocated settlement balances. HOLD 1 additionally persists
immutable journal monetary evidence, source snapshots, posting-rule lineage,
supplier-declared-tax evidence, and visible realized/unrealized/reporting
reconciliation feeds. Complete tax evidence snapshots and
rate validity bounds are persisted; historical values are never recomputed
from current rates. Mutations have Tenant/Company authorization, optimistic
concurrency, idempotency, audit, exact reversal, reconciliation, and explicit
blocked/ambiguous mapping outcomes. The Angular Finance Tax/FX workspace is
bilingual EN/AR with RTL support and evidence/status/error states. External
providers, bank feeds, statutory VAT/ZATCA/FATOORA, generic reporting, and
Wafra-specific core behavior remain outside this bounded capability.

at accepted feature head `c0e04553db3c7b04fa7f7870b60fc439ec8a40b7`; its

## Historical MESP-131 guarded merge snapshot - 24 August 2026

MESP-131 is merged through PR #75. The exact approved feature head is
`db624fbb71d15ee55022e247df0f83894d026257`, the required pre-merge main base
was `b470179e1d18ef75c0a9247b2340407da6220dc4`, and the exact squash/main SHA
is `a8664d6a0d006e463a1a03fadd76c28475475f58`. MESP-131 Jira closure is
recorded in comment `11842`; this guarded-merge snapshot is retained as
historical evidence and is superseded by the current MESP-132 snapshot above.
No Jira writes were performed by this guarded merge session.

MESP-131 final Opus P1 correction-quantity remediation is implemented on branch
`feat/MESP-131-mwa-valuation-reconciliation` at source/test commit
`64c4f4ea9b917119d07cb26df7ecac8c2239bfac`, from the exact required main
base `b470179e1d18ef75c0a9247b2340407da6220dc4`
and exact migration-repair session start
`48ddf07a645da0130699314243ae8b23907b3bfc`. The pre-repair implementation
baseline is `42794bda13bada7f37dcbf6ef6b8cc8e73eba889` and PR #75 is merged
into `main` at the squash SHA recorded above. No Jira writes were performed.

The bounded capability adds a Company-scoped durable `LedgerSequence` fence
for all Inventory movement-producing paths, deterministic legacy movement
bootstrap, policy-versioned decimal Moving Weighted Average valuation,
source/line/rate snapshots, append-only Applied/Pending/Blocked evidence,
predecessor blocking, backdated diagnostics, physical correction reversal
lineage, Warehouse Transfer shipment/in-transit/receipt/loss/return evidence,
Inventory-owned reconciliation and report filters, Finance-ready valuation
handoff facts without journals, and a bounded audited CSV export. The lazy
Angular surface exposes summary, MWA history, pending/blocked, reconciliation,
in-transit, Finance handoff, as-of/freshness, and EN/AR RTL controls. The final
remediation isolates known-policy blockers by valuation scope, keeps unknown
policy blockers conservative at the base pool, closes full depletion against
stored value with explicit formula/rounding/actual-value evidence, and makes
reconciliation fail closed as `ValuationMismatch` for impossible state. The
P1 correction fails drifted-average corrections closed as Blocked with
`correction_would_orphan_residual_value`, isolates the affected valuation
scope, preserves unrelated same-Company processing, keeps physical quantity at
Stock Ledger `decimal(28,8)` precision, and compares reconciliation quantities
without monetary rounding. No schema migration was required; the four Opus P2
observations remain deferred. The final correction delta removes monetary
`AmountScale` from correction quantity arithmetic and adds direct and
product-reachable fractional correction regressions proving
`1.005 - 0.001 = 1.004`, truthful outbound Finance evidence, final state
`1.004 / 100.40 / 100.00`, and exact `Reconciled` status. No QuantityScale,
tolerance, schema, or migration was added.

The overall Production-Ready Completion headline remains **~47%** and
Procurement/P2P remains **~41%**; these are not changed by the merge and are
not production-readiness claims. Fast-track capability completion is now
**15/26 = 57.7%** after the accepted MESP-131 merge, still separate from
production readiness. `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

## Superseded current snapshot - 23 August 2026 (MESP-130 final ledger-fence remediation; Sol acceptance handoff)

MESP-130 final ledger-fence remediation is implemented and pushed on branch
`feat/MESP-130-stock-control-corrections`, starting from exact bounded-session
SHA `9f5950848217bb992df7770baf93a91fa67b24ca` and main base
`6f6d204726cc4baf9979961ea6936c0d03e93e32`. The ledger-fence remediation
commit is `e63bcb3736138d3b3fb57ccd06646b6caf943e75`; Draft PR #74 remains
Open, Draft, and unmerged. No Jira writes or completion credit were inferred.

Full Count now establishes a durable `long`/SQL `bigint` warehouse movement
cardinality fence inside its Serializable persistence transaction before
authoritative identity discovery. Cycle Count remains selected-identity
scoped, with per-identity cardinality; unrelated movement remains irrelevant.
Append-only `inventory.CountSnapshots` rows preserve cutoff/cardinality
evidence for every generation, and posting compares the durable generation
fence to live ledger counts rather than relying on `PostedAt > SnapshotCutoff`.
The formal additive migration is
`20260823104702_MESP130InventoryCountLedgerFence`. Deterministic SQL tests
prove the actual reader has executed, the concurrent insert is blocked while
the count transaction holds the range fence, and a movement with an older
PostedAt cannot silently pass Full/Cycle posting.

The overall Production-Ready Completion headline remains **~47%** and
Procurement/P2P remains **~41%** pending Sol acceptance and merge. The
fast-track completed ratio remains **13/26 = 50.0%**; that ratio is not
production readiness. `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 22 August 2026 (MESP-130 implementation complete; Sol acceptance handoff)

MESP-130 is implemented at its bounded Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count,
Stock Issue, and eligible correction scope on branch
`feat/MESP-130-stock-control-corrections`, created from exact synchronized main
SHA `6f6d204726cc4baf9979961ea6936c0d03e93e32`. The implementation commit is
`1529cb29d1005cb2f2ff11a13b536815cb5a3b25`; Draft PR #74 is Open, Draft, and
unmerged. This implementation is pending Sol acceptance; no Jira writes or
completion credit were inferred.

The capability adds a Tenant-scoped bilingual reason/purpose catalogue,
adjustment lifecycle and correction, full/cycle count snapshots with blind
counter view, cutoff and post-cutoff resnapshot protection, recount/resnapshot,
variance authorization/posting, and reservation-safe stock issues and
corrections. It preserves immutable MESP-128/MESP-129 physical history,
deterministic anchors, server-derived Tenant and operational-context authority,
durable idempotency/source uniqueness, audit/history, REST/OpenAPI, formal
Inventory migration, and EN/AR RTL Angular workflow. MESP-131 owns MWA
valuation; new effects remain Pending valuation and create no Finance or
accounting effect. `frontend/assets` remains untouched.

The overall Production-Ready Completion headline remains **~47%** and
Procurement/P2P remains **~41%** pending acceptance and merge. The fast-track
completed ratio before MESP-130 acceptance is **13/26 = 50.0%**; that ratio is

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 22 August 2026 (MESP-129 OPUS P1 remediation complete; Sol delta handoff)

This snapshot records the bounded MESP-129 P1 Supplier Return stock-integrity
remediation on branch `feat/MESP-129-physical-stock-movements`, created from
the exact required starting SHA
`b5a0aaca856d571089c65d341de4b8e19205793d`. The implementation/test commit is
`a824e8a`; Draft PR #73 remains open, Draft, and unmerged. This is correctness
remediation within the existing capability, so the ~47% overall and ~41%
Procurement/P2P headlines remain unchanged. No Jira write or completion credit
was inferred.

Supplier Return posting now resolves OnHand and active Reserved once per
distinct StockIdentityKey, validates cumulative outbound quantity before any
movement is created, and preserves one immutable movement for every commercial
return line. The three executable regressions cover same-identity over-capacity,
reservation protection, and exact-boundary success with distinct PO/GR/return
lineage. The current Supplier Return physical/commercial lifecycle gate remains
valid only with one active API process; horizontal API scale-out is not approved
until durable cross-instance coordination replaces or supplements that gate.

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 22 August 2026 (MESP-129 Sol acceptance remediation complete; delta handoff)

This snapshot records the bounded MESP-129 physical Inventory implementation on
branch `feat/MESP-129-physical-stock-movements`, created from the exact
synchronized main base `2cf6b315c69c87f26ca4bbfc774e3e0eb451c5e3`. The
code-complete implementation commit is
`01ea8f7369d173c15cf55a723d6bd95006208282`; Draft PR #73 is open and remains
unmerged. The Sol remediation started from the exact synchronized local/remote
branch SHA `380e104292523fe7930493263ed043d6d354d685`. The verified source
remediation commit is `cf40f97c70603bd90996dc4567e2a3215f317c7b`. This bounded
delta strengthens Supplier Return physical-effect lifecycle protection,
truthful replay/handoff-state convergence, SQL-compatible receipt-reference
canonicalization, and the associated regressions; the
production headline remains conservatively unchanged until Sol acceptance and
merge; no Jira completion credit is inferred from implementation or test
activity.

Goods Receipt accepted quantities now create one immutable inbound Inventory
effect through the authoritative Procurement source, while rejected quantities
remain outside stock and cancellation is blocked after an active physical
effect. Supplier Return physical posting consumes only the authoritative
AwaitingInventory source and preserves PO/GR/return lineage, reservation-safe
outbound behavior, durable source uniqueness, retry convergence, and explicit
duplicate audit evidence. Inventory-owned direct and two-step Warehouse
Transfers support same-Company server-authorized warehouses, derived InTransit,
partial receipt, explicit shortage/loss resolution, overage rejection, and safe
pre-shipment cancellation. New physical movements are explicitly Pending
valuation with nullable cost/currency; MESP-131 valuation and Finance effects
remain downstream. Customer Return is only an unavailable authoritative Sales
integration seam. No MESP-130, MESP-131, commercial Sales, Finance, external,
statutory, or Wafra-specific behavior was added.

Tracked Procurement physical sources without authoritative tracking identity
now fail closed without a fabricated bucket; Goods Receipt cancellation has
active/no-effect/unavailable verification with no mutation on unavailable;
Supplier Return replay probes durable Inventory before Procurement eligibility;
duplicate transfer receipt references converge with audit evidence and no extra
movement; receipt acquires the MESP-128 destination anchor; and SQL safety
migrates one disposable catalog through all five committed module contexts in
order without `EnsureCreated`. Supplier Return Cancel/Reverse/Correct now fail
closed on active or unavailable physical-effect verification, the Inventory
post/handoff race is serialized by Supplier Return ID, terminal replay state
cannot fabricate handoff success, and the disposable SQL Server LocalDB proof
covers `RECEIVE-001` followed by `receive-001` with one receipt movement.

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 22 August 2026 (MESP-128 Opus stock-integrity delta remediation complete; delta-only review handoff)

This snapshot records the bounded MESP-128 Opus stock-integrity delta remediation
on branch feat/MESP-128-inventory-ledger-foundation, created from the exact
synchronized main base f54b6abe383edd304911eb0a53db43fafdcb3066. The delta
starting head was 7e1df0f9a4f27f9f7e0dad91170accd8247c8236. This is correctness
remediation within the already delivered MESP-128 capability, so the overall
~47% and Procurement/P2P ~41% headlines remain unchanged. No Jira statistics
or completion credit were inferred from ticket activity.

The delta removes ExtractedAt from the business source fingerprint while
retaining it as evidence; makes the single-row frontend source reference
truthful and stable; narrowly classifies SQL 1205/1222 contention; adds a
provider-independent mutable TouchSequence anchor write; removes the
nullable-Branch unique-index filter; and adds executable SQLite/LocalDB SQL
regressions for duplicate provenance, anchor persistence, database uniqueness,
real contention, and overlapping reservation non-overallocation.
No Goods Receipt authoritative Inventory posting, transfer, InTransit, Stock
Adjustment, Count, Issue, MWA valuation, Finance/AP/AR/GL, tax/payment,
external/statutory, production cutover, or Wafra-specific core behavior was
added. MESP-129, MESP-130, and MESP-131 remain downstream.

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 21 August 2026 (MESP-127 Supplier Return implementation complete; Sol acceptance handoff)

This snapshot records the bounded MESP-127 Supplier Return, correction,
evidence, audit, and Procurement reporting implementation on branch
`feat/MESP-127-supplier-return-corrections`, created from the exact synchronized
main base `e5568c1ea186995dcc4f0cb0075b2f6b20a15064`. This is a genuine bounded
Procurement capability increase, so the headline moves conservatively from
~44% to ~45% overall and from ~39% to ~41% for Procurement/P2P. No Jira
statistics or completion credit were inferred from ticket activity.

Supplier Returns now preserve PO/PO-line, Supplier Confirmation, Goods Receipt/
receipt-line, Supplier, Warehouse, Product/UOM, quantity, reason/condition,
commercial outcome, private evidence-reference, correction/reversal lineage,
authorization, and immutable Tenant/Company/Branch snapshots. Eligibility is
server-derived from accepted receipt quantity less active non-reversed return
quantity; rejected quantity and the non-additive MESP-125 damage overlay never
become return quantity. Lifecycle actions, source-version touching,
optimistic concurrency, durable idempotency, history/audit, Inventory handoff
evidence, Finance correction-reference evidence, and operational report rows
are included. No Inventory stock ledger/on-hand/valuation, Finance AP/GL/tax/

This snapshot records the bounded P1 remediation commit
`d2a107e427df335a0067c77c30d07562608ab743` on branch
`feat/MESP-126-three-way-matching-tolerances`. The public cross-currency
request is now identity-only (`ExchangeRateId`); MESP-120 version selection is
server-authoritative from immutable supplier-invoice-date evidence, with the
existing immutable handoff date as the only fallback and missing-date failure
closed. Supplier-declared quantities aggregate by Purchase Order line, receipt
allocations aggregate by Goods Receipt line, duplicate evidence remains
truthful and is classified against active accepted/handoff-supported quantity,
and the existing individual price/tax/amount and header comparisons remain
intact. The Angular workspace now provides an EN/AR RTL-accessible,

## Historical fast-track snapshot - 20 August 2026 (MESP-126 SOL acceptance remediation complete; independent review handoff)

This snapshot records the bounded implementation of MESP-126 — Three-way
Matching, Tolerances, and Authorized Exception Resolution — on branch
`feat/MESP-126-three-way-matching-tolerances`. It adds independent
supplier-declared invoice evidence beside the preserved MESP-125 PO-derived
handoff preview, explicit accepted Goods Receipt allocations, deterministic
exact-safe/configured tolerance evaluation, currency comparability with
retained applied-rate evidence, structured variance and hold outcomes,
authorized reasoned exception resolution, durable history/audit/replay,
optimistic concurrency, REST/OpenAPI registration, EF Core migrations, and a
bilingual EN/AR RTL matching workspace. This remains Procurement evidence
orchestration; it does not post Finance/AP/GL, mutate stock, settle payment,
submit statutory data, or add external integrations.

The remediation also closes SOL acceptance findings: quantity compares the
current partial handoff/source quantity, over/under supplier declarations remain
truthful evidence, cumulative active declarations are bounded by accepted or
confirmed source quantity, runtime tolerance and resolution/SoD policy is
configuration-led, and cross-currency matching resolves immutable
server-authoritative MESP-120 Exchange Rate snapshots. Headline percentages are
unchanged because this session is correctness remediation rather than additive
scope.

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 final Opus P2 remediation)

This snapshot records the final bounded P2/P3 remediation pass requested by
the independent Claude Opus 5 MESP-124 review. It corrects multi-stage
supplier-change approval stage reset, adds direct reapproval actor/delegation
and duplicate-source behavior coverage, and adds bilingual terminal source
recovery guidance while preserving the accepted commercial-integrity,
source-decision uniqueness, immutable durable replay, HTTP failure
classification, and Purchase Order accessibility corrections. It does not
add downstream Procurement, Inventory, Finance, external, production, or
Wafra-specific scope, and it does not increase the conservative
production-capability percentages.

| MESP-124 | Remediation is implemented on `feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation`; Draft PR #68 remains OPEN/DRAFT/UNMERGED; Jira remained read-only and In Progress with activation evidence `11394`. |
| Remediation scope | Confirmation facts now survive supplier commercial-change approval/rejection with recomputed ordered/confirmed/remaining/status values; one Tenant + Source Decision lifetime is enforced by a new additive unique-index migration `20260818103736_PurchaseOrderCommercialIntegrityAndDurableReplay`; successful operation responses are stored as versioned immutable audit snapshots; completed supplier-change approval stages reset approver IDs/count before the next stage; duplicate-source behavior and reapproval delegation are directly covered; terminal PO recovery explains the new-source-decision rule in EN/AR; approval/HTTP semantics and PO dialog/tab/table accessibility are hardened. |
| Production capability | **~40% overall; Procurement/P2P conservatively ~28%** — unchanged; this is correctness and review remediation, not additive business capability. |
| Validation | Backend **793/793 passed, 0 skipped** including the SQL safety harness against disposable LocalDB; focused Purchase Order tests **14/14** and focused Purchase Order + REST foundation tests **47/47**; Angular **216/216** across 25 spec files; production build **492.02 kB initial / 76.78 kB Purchase Order lazy / 91.94 kB Supplier Quotation lazy**; both production-only and full `npm audit` report **0 vulnerabilities**; focused Purchase Order Playwright **8/8** and full Chromium Playwright **16/16** passed; official runtime configuration smoke passed, live API health/module-registration and Angular root/PO-route checks returned HTTP 200 on API 5300 / Angular 4300, with the unauthenticated API PO list retaining its expected 401 boundary. |

Do not merge this branch or start MESP-125. |

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 durable idempotency ordering correction)

This snapshot records a second bounded bug-fix/regression session, not new
capability; the Procurement/P2P production-capability percentage is unchanged.
GPT-5.6 Sol confirmed F-1 closed and accepted the F-2 SHA-256 request
fingerprint design and persistence-side conflict detection, but raised one
remaining F-2 **completeness** finding: `PurchaseOrderService` ran
lifecycle-state, concurrency, approval-stage, approval-policy, delegation,
supplier-change, and reapproval checks before persisted idempotency evidence
could be consulted, so an identical retry stopped being replayable once the
original success advanced state — permanently so once the volatile ten-minute
REST idempotency cache expired or the API process restarted. Claude Sonnet 5,
sole executor, closed it by adding a bounded read-only durable replay probe
(`IPurchaseOrderPersistence.ProbeReplayAsync`, NotFound/Replay/Conflict) over
the already-stored Tenant-scoped audit evidence and calling it in the correct
position, with no schema change and no rewrite of the accepted additive
migration.

This session closed the final F-2 completeness finding with zero Jira write. |
| Production capability | **~40% overall; Procurement/P2P phase conservatively ~28%** — unchanged; this is correction work, not additive business scope. |
| Security ordering | Replay is not an authorization bypass: the probe runs only after trusted Tenant context, current target resolution, and current actor authorization, and before lifecycle/concurrency/approval-stage/policy/delegation/supplier-change/reapproval validation. Replay is matched on the exact actor, so separation of duties still holds; a genuinely new create still runs full current source-decision validation; the in-transaction persistence-side replay check is retained as defense in depth. |
| Validation | Release build 0 warnings/0 errors; official backend runner **778/778 passed, 0 skipped** (up from 774; +4 new durable-replay regression tests) against disposable LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_20260818103729_8fb927af`, SQL safety harness genuinely executed, runner cleanup succeeded, **zero orphan `MiniErpFoundation_*` databases**, persistent `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` unchanged and persistent `MESP` intact; targeted `PurchaseOrderTests`/`RestFoundationTests` **41/41** (up from 37); the 4 new tests verified load-bearing (4/4 fail against the pre-correction service while the 4 pre-existing PO tests still pass). Backend-only: no frontend source, dependency, or asset file changed, so Angular **212/212**, build **492.02 kB initial / 72.94 kB PO lazy / 91.94 kB quotation lazy**, and Chromium **15/15** stand unchanged from the prior session; `npm audit` unchanged at **1 high** (pre-existing `nanoid` transitive advisory; `npm audit fix` not run and dependency files untouched — a separate pre-production Owner/Sol dependency-security follow-up). |
| Boundaries | No Goods Receipt, stock, warehouse, invoice, AP/accounting, payment, three-way matching, supplier portal, external integration, ZATCA/FATOORA, DNS/TLS, or Wafra-specific core behavior. Production/provider, MESP-48/MESP-50, specialist, legal, migration, and cutover gates remain open. |
| Next exact session | Independent Claude Opus 5 MESP-124 pre-merge review, with `TASK.md` updated to require explicit verification of durable replay after cache expiry/process restart, the six state-advanced replay scenarios, the `ChangedPendingApproval` confirmation replay, absence of duplicate history/audit/evidence, and unchanged 409 conflict semantics; branch remains unmerged and MESP-125 is not started. |

## Historical authoritative fast-track snapshot - 18 August 2026 (MESP-124 pre-Opus Sol findings correction; superseded by the durable idempotency ordering correction)

This snapshot records a bounded bug-fix correction session, not new capability;
the Procurement/P2P production-capability percentage is unchanged from the
MESP-124 implementation snapshot below, since currency-rendering resilience
and idempotency-fidelity hardening are correctness corrections to already-
counted capability rather than additive scope. Claude Sonnet 5, sole
executor, resolved two GPT-5.6 Sol pre-Opus findings (F-1 currency rendering
resilience; F-2 idempotency replay/conflict fidelity) on
`feat/MESP-124-purchase-order-confirmation`, Draft PR #68, with focused

| MESP-123 Phase C | The repository-only Supplier Quotation / Comparison backend/API slice is complete on `feat/MESP-123-purchase-request-approval`, building on the Purchase Request backend and functional UI/integration seams: approved-request-only capture, immutable request/line/Product/UOM/quantity/need-by snapshots, server-resolved Supplier/Currency/Tax/Payment Term snapshots, Draft/Submitted/Withdrawn/Disqualified/Superseded lifecycle, bounded evidence references, deterministic comparison with explicit mixed-currency/no-FX treatment, one current source decision with rationale and comparison snapshot, superseded history/audit, optimistic concurrency, idempotency, Tenant authorization, and 12 generated REST/OpenAPI/Scalar operations. Focused quotation tests pass 5/5; full non-SQL backend validation is 726/726; Release build is 0 warnings/0 errors; 21 SQL safety cases remain gated. Angular remains unchanged at the Phase C baseline of 158/158 with a 439.15 kB initial bundle. No Purchase Order, confirmation, receipt, invoice, AP/accounting, payment, stock, supplier portal, external provider, Jira/external-tracker, MESP-124, or `frontend/assets` work was performed in Phase C; B2 now follows this backend/API slice, and the next exact session is the functional Angular Supplier Quotation / Comparison UI with source-selection/rationale UX. |
| MESP-123 Phase B2 | The bounded post-Phase-C foundation is complete on the same Draft PR branch: canonical `/app/workspaces` shell routing with `/tenant/select` compatibility, sidebar defect correction, server/configured human Tenant labels with local `Wafra` fixture naming, read-only legacy Wafra-inspired glass/surface and dense ERP-grid primitives, representative Workspace and Purchase Request list/detail adoption, exact-Development loopback-only server-actor authentication, local SQL Server `MESP` cutover, and transparent theme-aware branding derivatives. Formal migrations run Tenancy → Master Data → Business Parties → Procurement with distinct history tables; Tenancy alone owns `tenancy.TenantOwnedRecords`. The cutover utility verified 59 mapped rows, IDs/Tenant IDs, foreign-key lineage, source hashes, and recoverable backups while retaining SQLite originals. Backend Release build is 0/0 and the complete suite is 752/752 including SQL safety; Angular is 190/190 across 20 spec files with a 459.20 kB initial build; Playwright is 4/4 and `npm audit` has 0 vulnerabilities. Real browser validation passed for light/dark branding, transparent/collapsed shell, RTL layout, server-derived Tenant naming, and two migrated Purchase Requests. No Jira or external-tracker operation was performed; Owner source assets remain unchanged. Production deployment/migration and MESP-48/MESP-50 gates remain open. |
| MESP-123 Supplier Quotation / Comparison UI | The bounded functional Angular slice is present on the same Draft PR branch: lazy Supplier Quotation list with bounded search/status/currency filters and honest loading/empty/error/retry states; approved-Purchase-Request lineage and server-provided organization/reference selectors; Draft create/edit with Supplier/Currency/Tax/Payment Term/evidence references; server-flagged submit/withdraw/disqualify actions with If-Match/idempotency; detail tabs for summary, lines, commercial terms, evidence, comparison, lifecycle history, audit, and technical reference; same-currency comparison groups, mixed-currency/no-FX boundaries, qualification issues, source selection, required rationale, persisted decision history, and current selection. The only backend change is the Tenant-scoped read endpoint exposing existing immutable source-decision history; no business rule is duplicated in Angular. Angular validation is 197/197 across 22 spec files; the initial production bundle is 478.57 kB with a 91.72 kB lazy quotation chunk; the complete automated Playwright suite is 6/6 (focused quotation coverage 2/2); npm audit --omit=dev reports 0 vulnerabilities. A real local SQL-backed API journey passed create/edit/submit, withdraw, disqualify, quotation history/audit, mixed-currency comparison, source decision, and source-decision history; SQL row counts after the journey are 4 quotations, 4 lines, 2 evidence rows, 11 quotation-history rows, 12 quotation-audit rows, 1 source decision, and 1 source-decision-history row (all quotation/source tables were 0 before the journey). Backend Release build is 0 warnings/0 errors. |
| MESP-123 Harness Reconciliation | The pre-Opus validation harness reconciliation is complete on the same branch: permanent architectural separation between `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` (Development runtime SQL Server `.` / `MESP`) and `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING` (disposable `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` / `MiniErpFoundation_*`); `SqlServerSafetyFixture` now reads only the dedicated safety variable; new architectural test `Runtime_connection_string_is_not_accepted_as_safety_configuration` added; `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` introduced; `scripts/validate-foundation.ps1` updated; `README.md` badge link corrected (removed misleading MIT license link) and quality checks updated; `Run.md`, `backend/README.md`, `docs/ADR-018`, and `TASK.md` Opus step 5 instructions reconciled. Backend full test suite is **753/753 passing with 0 warnings/0 errors** (all 22 SQL safety tests executed against disposable LocalDB and passed); Angular is **197/197**; Playwright is **6/6**; `npm audit` has **0 vulnerabilities**; persistent MESP runtime is untouched and intact. |
| MESP-123 Opus Findings Correction | The pre-merge corrective session resolved all Opus review findings on the same branch: F-1 resilient currency formatting with localized decimal fallback for valid non-ISO MESP currency codes; F-2 source-decision concurrency passthrough enforcing caller ETag on first decision and reselection; F-5/F-6 documentation, bundle, and test suite reconciliation. Backend suite is **754/754 passed** with 0 warnings/0 errors; Angular unit tests are **202/202 passed across 22 spec files**; Playwright E2E is **8/8 passed across 2 spec files**; `npm audit --omit=dev` is **0 vulnerabilities**; production bundle is **478.57 kB initial total** (116.51 kB transfer) and **91.94 kB lazy quotation chunk** (15.73 kB transfer); PR #66 remains open, Draft, and unmerged. |
| MESP-123 Governance Reconciliation | Bounded repository governance reconciliation inherited approved ADR-019 and MESP-143 execution plan into AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .ai/CURRENT_STATE.md, and TASK.md. Established Tenant != Workspace, Overview-first, Wafra branding configuration, and Saudi Riyal SAR presentation rules. Zero product code changes; no progress percentage inflation; MESP-143 remains planned/To Do; next exact step is Claude Opus 5 targeted re-verification of F-1/F-2/F-5 per TASK.md. |
| MESP-123 Draft PR | Draft PR #66 is open against `main` for the Phase C + B2 + Supplier Quotation / Comparison UI + Harness Reconciliation + Opus Findings Correction + Governance Reconciliation handoff; it is intentionally unmerged and remains Draft. |
| Capability backlog | MESP-122 repository source is complete and merged; Jira closure remains pending GPT-5.6 Sol. MESP-123 Phase C, B2, Supplier Quotation UI, validation harness reconciliation, and Opus findings correction are complete only at their repository scopes; no Jira/external-tracker state was changed. MESP-124-MESP-142 remain under existing Epics and are not started by this session. The exact next session is an independent Claude Opus 5 MESP-123 capability review; no Purchase Order. |
| Decision Pack | 31 canonical entries: A1-A16 and B1-B6 approved only at their exact bounded positions; Class B is contract-bound with mandatory specialist validation before production or irreversible decisions; C1-C9 remain open gates. |
| Tax/VAT | Internal reusable configuration-led Tax/VAT is implemented at the bounded MESP-119 scope with Tenant-safe identity, effective history, explicit-input deterministic calculation, evidence, audit, API/OpenAPI/Scalar, and Angular UX; statutory/ZATCA/FATOORA/external scope remains excluded. |
| MESP-39 / MESP-40 | MESP-39 remains future-release and unactivated; MESP-40 remains an unactivated Release 1 migration requirement and was not activated by MESP-116. |
| Source/production capability | MESP-122 Phase A/B/C/C1 and the bounded P1-1 backend correction are source-complete and merged in PR #65 squash commit `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`. MESP-123 now has the bounded Phase C Supplier Quotation capture/comparison/source-decision API, B2 shared shell/branding/Development hardening/SQL cutover, the functional Angular Supplier Quotation / Comparison UI, and the dedicated SQL safety harness separation. It is not a complete Procurement/P2P capability and does not create a Purchase Order or downstream effect. Production deployment, backup/restore, capacity, legal/privacy, specialist, MESP-48, and MESP-50 gates remain open; independent Opus review remains required and no external tracker state was changed. |

Jira counts were not re-read or modified in this repository-only session. The
last repository-recorded snapshot during MESP-122 activation was **80 Done / 7 In Progress / 55 To Do
administrative counts and must not be used as the production-capability
percentage.

The canonical management artifacts are the full-feature plan,

# 1. Mandatory Update Rule

This file is a **living project-control document** and MUST be reviewed and updated at the end of every implementation, correction, architecture, planning, BRD, review, or production-readiness session that materially changes project status.

Every future AI/executor/reviewer session must:

1. Read this file before execution when the task can materially change delivery progress.
2. Complete exactly the bounded task assigned by root `TASK.md`.
3. Re-check the current repository, Jira state, implementation status, and validation evidence.
4. Update only statistics materially affected by the completed session.
5. Update the following fields when applicable:
   - Overall production-ready completion percentage.
   - Product/requirements completion.
   - Architecture/foundation completion.
   - Backend completion.
   - Database/persistence completion.
   - Frontend completion.
   - End-to-end system completion.
   - Production-readiness completion.
   - Per-phase progress.
   - Per-Epic progress.
   - Current module/slice progress.
   - Jira issue statistics.
   - Delivery velocity.
   - Remaining effort.
   - Forecast dates.
   - Current critical blockers.
   - Current milestone.
6. Preserve historical tracking instead of rewriting past milestones as if they never existed.
7. Do not increase percentages merely because documentation or Jira tickets were created.
8. Count progress toward **usable production capability**, not administrative activity.
9. Do not mark a phase 100% until its agreed production Definition of Done is satisfied.
10. Update `Last Updated` and append a row to the Progress History section.
11. Keep percentages conservative and evidence-based.
12. Never hard-code Wafra-specific behavior into the reusable SaaS platform.
13. Stop and flag unresolved business, accounting, data-integrity, tenant-isolation, legal/compliance, destructive migration, or production blockers rather than hiding them inside a percentage.

## Required end-of-session statistics check

Every future execution prompt should include:

> Before finishing the session, review `docs/staticts.md` and update it if this session materially changed project progress, phase completion, Jira statistics, implementation status, blockers, velocity, or forecast dates. Keep the percentages evidence-based and based on production capability rather than ticket count. Update the Last Updated date and append a Progress History entry. Do not change unrelated statistics.

---

# 2. Executive Progress Summary

| Metric | Current Estimate |
|---|---:|
| Product / Requirements Definition | **~45%** |
| Architecture & Technical Foundation | **~90%** |
| Backend Overall | **~69%** |
| Database / Persistence Overall | **~62%** |
| Frontend Overall | **~42%** |
| Automated Technical Safety Foundation | **~65%** |
| Full End-to-End Business System | **~42%** |
| Production Readiness | **~31%** |
| **Remaining to Real Production** | **~58%** |

## Historical management headline - pre-MESP-137 tracker

> **Mini ERP SaaS Platform Release 1 is approximately 45% complete toward a genuinely production-ready system.**

This percentage is intentionally lower than the raw Jira completion percentage because many completed Jira items represent architecture, governance, BRD, authorization, and technical-foundation work rather than completed business capabilities.

The project has already completed a disproportionately important part of the difficult foundation work. The local SQL-backed Development path and
verified data cutover increase implementation confidence, but do not close the
production deployment, backup/restore, capacity, legal, or specialist gates.

---

# 3. Raw Jira Progress vs Real Production Progress

Current approximate non-Epic Jira state:

| Jira Status | Approx. Issues | Approx. % |
|---|---:|---:|
| Done | **80** | **63.0%** |
| In Progress | **2** | **1.6%** |
| To Do | **45** | **35.4%** |
| **Total Non-Epic** | **127** | **100%** |

Major Release-1 Epics:

**15 Epics**

Across all 142 MESP issues, including the 15 Epics, the current workflow state
is 80 Done, 7 In Progress, and 55 To Do. These counts were re-checked in live
Jira on 14 August 2026; the two non-Epic In Progress items are MESP-23 and
MESP-122.

## Interpretation

Raw Jira completion currently makes the non-Epic board appear approximately
**63% complete** (80 of 127 non-Epic issues Done).

That number must NOT be used as the production-completion percentage.

The full-feature capability backlog is now enumerated in MESP-117–MESP-142,
but ticket creation remains administrative activity and does not create
production capability.

Therefore the current project should be represented as:

> **Jira-created-work completion: ~62% of non-Epic issues**
> **Actual Release-1 production completion: ~36%**

**Jira hygiene note:** MESP-97 and MESP-98 were stale duplicate/superseded
SL-02 administrative artifacts. They have now been reconciled to terminal Done
with explicit superseded/duplicate comments; MESP-99 and MESP-100 remain the
authoritative completed implementation/readiness records, MESP-101 is the
completed Product readiness record, and MESP-102 is Done for the bounded Product
implementation with activation/validation/closure comments `10675`/`10676`/
`10677`. MESP-103 is Done with Supplier-only Owner disposition and closure

`10769`/`10770`/`10771`/`10772`/`10773`/`10774`/`10775`. MESP-53 remains the
critical To Do/unapproved Reporting dependency; MESP-54 and FIN-OD-09 /
MESP-110 remain To Do/unapproved, MESP-23 remains In Progress, and Currency
remains unexecuted. MESP-111 is Done through documentation-only PR #53 at
merge 1bcf1aa75292b927bc165a2a4fb1a8ca737763cf, from reviewed head
51aee480319412ca43a7d97d1af295e1aab775d8, with activation/closure evidence
10809/10810; the verdict remains draft-only with qualified external
validation outstanding. MESP-112 is Done through documentation-only PR #54,
reviewed at 65dd650776b2c3abb06c36987b68152deb776958 and merged at
6e501d1f2a018c36b76339388ce7b7f09ed9c937. MESP-49 is Done for Release 1
scope only; MESP-50 remains open; MESP-37 is Done through the bounded
product-only Saudi Localization/Core ERP BRD; MESP-23 remains In Progress; and
PD-023 is appended to MESP-22. MESP-114 is Done after the bounded Pre-MESP-38
independent-review reconciliation and focused PR #56; MESP-113 is the durable
INV-OD-004 owner and remains To Do/unapproved. The prior MESP-38 checkpoint
had 60 Done / 6 In Progress / 48 To Do across all issues, and 60 Done / 1
In Progress / 38 To Do for non-Epic work; the current counts are in the
authoritative fast-track snapshot above. MESP-38 is Done through focused documentation-only
PR #57 at merge 67b7fb79475fb194489bc03ed153c999d20a6eaf from reviewed head
42f2a1cb7b15580a6a92c4603253b6ea5104c203, with Jira evidence
10934/10935/10936/10937/10938/10939. Its canonical BRD is
docs/29_Security_Audit_and_Data_Governance_BRD.md; MESP-39 remains a future-
release BRD and is To Do/not activated/not executed.
The Customer-specific MD-OD-001/005/008 disposition and the preceding
documentation-only session notes are retained as historical slice evidence.
MESP-116 is Done at its bounded governance scope. MESP-117 is now the
completed first capability implementation, with its shared five-slice Angular
workspace and Category/UOM public REST seam recorded in the authoritative
snapshot above; the exact next handoff is MESP-118. PD-033, PD-035, PD-036, and
PD-037 are authoritative at their exact approved global Master Data boundaries,
while Procurement Supplier Confirmation remains MESP-124. MESP-39 remains
future-release To Do and not activated, and MESP-40 remains an unactivated
Release 1 migration requirement.

# 4. Historical weighted production model by major phase

This dated planning model is retained for methodology and forecast history. It
predates the current MESP-128–MESP-132 implementation chain; the authoritative
current production-readiness headline is the ~47% snapshot at the top of this
tracker, not the historical arithmetic below.

The following model represents progress toward a complete production Release 1.

| Phase | Weight of Final Product | Current Completion | Current Contribution |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1. Product governance, requirements, business decisions | 8% | **45%** | 3.6% |
| 2. Architecture, security & technical foundation | 12% | **87%** | 10.4% |
| 3. Platform Admin / IAM / Tenancy / Organization | 8% | **55%** | 4.4% |
| 4. Master Data & Product Catalog | 10% | **68%** | 6.8% |
| 5. Procurement / Purchase-to-Pay | 9% | **35%** | 3.2% |
| 6. Inventory / Warehouse | 9% | **5%** | 0.5% |
| 7. Finance / Accounting / AR / AP / Cash | 12% | **4%** | 0.5% |
| 8. B2B Sales / Order-to-Cash | 9% | **3%** | 0.3% |
| 9. Reporting & Analytics | 4% | **2%** | 0.1% |
| 10. Complete Angular Frontend / EN-AR / RTL | 8% | **40%** | 3.2% |
| 11. Saudi Compliance & External Integrations | 4% | **8%** | 0.3% |
| 12. Migration / Tenant Onboarding | 2% | **3%** | 0.1% |
| 13. E2E QA, Performance, UAT, Deployment & Go-Live | 5% | **25%** | 1.3% |

**Historical weighted result at the time of this model:** approximately **42%**.

The weighted model remains an approximate planning band; the bounded
Currency/Payment Terms, Tax/VAT, Exchange Rate, Supplier Quotation/source
decision, Purchase Order/Supplier Confirmation, Goods Receipt, and Purchase
Invoice Handoff foundations support the conservative current 42% headline
below without resolving the SQL/provider,
specialist, or production gates. The approved MESP-33 Inventory BRD is a documentation
baseline only and does not increase usable Inventory or overall production
capability.

For project reporting use:

> **Historical production-ready completion at this checkpoint = 42%**

Do not present decimal precision as certainty.

---

# 5. Progress by Release-1 Epic

These percentages measure **usable production capability**, not Jira workflow status.
The table is a historical planning estimate retained for forecast continuity;
the current module/capability status is the matrix near the top of this file.

| Epic | Area | Current Estimate |
|---|---|---:|
| MESP-1 | Product Governance & BRD Management | **70%** |
| MESP-2 | SaaS Platform Administration | **35%** |
| MESP-3 | Identity & Access Management | **65%** |
| MESP-4 | Multi-Tenancy | **75%** |
| MESP-5 | Organization & Company Structure | **50%** |
| MESP-6 | Master Data & Product Catalog | **68%** |
| MESP-7 | Procurement & Purchase-to-Pay | **18–20%** |
| MESP-8 | Inventory & Warehouse | **3–5%** |
| MESP-9 | B2B Sales & Order-to-Cash | **3–5%** |
| MESP-10 | Finance & Accounting | **3–5%** |
| MESP-11 | Reporting & Analytics | **2–3%** |
| MESP-12 | Saudi Localization & Compliance | **8–10%** |
| MESP-13 | Security, Audit & Data Governance | **40–45%** |
| MESP-14 | Integrations & External Services | **12–15%** |
| MESP-15 | Migration & Tenant Onboarding | **3–5%** |

## Notes

Security/Audit has meaningful reusable technical implementation even though some formal business-definition work remains outstanding.

Procurement, Inventory, Finance, B2B Sales, Reporting, Saudi Compliance, Integrations, and Migration still have substantial BRD/specification/implementation work ahead.

# 6. Master Data & Product Catalog Progress

The approved Master Data implementation specification contains 12 slices. The
planning table below is retained as the sequential slice baseline; the current
SL-03 status is recorded in the current assessment immediately below it.

| Slice | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| SL-01 | Shared Boundary & Tenant/Scope Contracts | ✅ Done |
| SL-02 | Category & UOM | ✅ Implemented, corrected, and merged |
| SL-03 | Product Identity | Done: bounded implementation merged through PR #37 |
| SL-04 | Supplier | Done: bounded implementation merged through PR #39 |
| SL-05 | Business Customer | Done: bounded implementation merged through PR #41 |
| SL-06 | Currency | Implemented at bounded MESP-118 scope and merged through PR #61 |
| SL-07 | Payment Term | Implemented at bounded MESP-118 scope and merged through PR #61 |
| SL-08 | Tax | ✅ Implemented at bounded MESP-119 scope and merged through PR #62 |
| SL-09 | Exchange Rate | Implemented at bounded MESP-120 scope and merged through PR #63 |
| SL-10 | Price List | ✅ Implemented at bounded MESP-121 scope and merged through PR #64 |
| SL-11 | Import / Migration | ✅ Bounded source capability merged through PR #65; provider/migration gates remain open |
| SL-12 | Audit / Reporting / Downstream Integration | ✅ Bounded source capability merged through PR #65; reporting/provider/specialist gates remain open |

### Current bounded-slice status

The planning rows above preserve the sequential slice baseline. Current
delivery status is authoritative here: **SL-03 Product Identity is bounded,
validated, and merged through PR #37; SL-04 Supplier is implemented through PR
#39; SL-05 Business Customer is implemented through PR #41; SL-06 Currency and
SL-07 Payment Term are implemented through PR #61; SL-08 Tax is implemented
through PR #62; SL-09 Exchange Rate is implemented through PR #63; and SL-10
Price List is implemented and merged through PR #64.**
MESP-105 readiness and Customer-only MD-OD-001/005/008 disposition remain
recorded in Jira comments `10691` and `10693`; the later activation,
validation, and closure evidence is preserved in the current snapshot and
historical progress rows.

## Master Data current assessment

Current post-MESP-122 source-merged position:

**~68%**, with shared Angular maintenance journeys covering Category, UOM,
Product, Supplier, Business Customer, Currency, Payment Terms, Tax, Exchange
Rate, and Price List, plus the Category/UOM public REST seam and the
Currency/Payment Terms/Tax/Exchange Rate/Price List API, persistence,
effective-history, reference, applied-evidence, and deterministic selection
contracts. MESP-122 is activated for import mechanics, audit/reporting
integration, and downstream reference integrity. Phase A provides the backend
import engine, durable batch/row/audit persistence, ten entity-specific
processors, simulation/commit/replay behavior, reconciliation, and the
Foundation REST/OpenAPI seam. Phase B added the Angular nonvisual integration
seam (TypeScript contracts, CSV/JSON parser, API service, reactive facade,
safe error codes), and Phase C added the real Angular Master Data Import
Workspace/Wizard UI (6-step wizard, mapping, capped preview,
reconciliation-gated execute, row outcome/quarantine-replay UI, batch
history/detail, full EN/AR/RTL) and the bounded Opus P1-1 correction, squash-
merged through PR #65 at `a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659`. The
SQL/provider gate remains open, so this is not a production-ready claim; the
conservative increase from the documented 65–68% range to 68% is source-merge
evidence, not Jira activity or production readiness.

Historical pre-SL-03 pure implementation-slice completion:

**~16–17%**

Total lifecycle completion including BRD, lean specification, architecture,
authorization contracts, persistence-readiness work, the completed bounded
source slices, the shared MESP-117 UX/API seam, the MESP-118 Currency/Payment
Terms capability, the MESP-119 Tax/VAT capability, the MESP-120 Exchange Rate
capability, and the MESP-121 Price List capability:

**~65%**

Current post-MESP-122 source-merged position:

**~68%**, with the shared ten-slice Angular workspace, Currency/Payment
Terms/Tax/Exchange Rate/Price List REST and persistence contracts, the Price
List backend/Angular capability, and MESP-122 Phase A backend import/audit/read
contracts validated. Phase A includes Tenant-owned import batches and rows,
entity-specific validation and duplicate policy, dry-run simulation, partial
success reconciliation, quarantined-row replay, deterministic evidence, and
the generated Foundation REST/OpenAPI seam. Phase B and Phase C are also now
complete (Angular nonvisual integration seam and the real Angular Import
Workspace/Wizard UI, respectively), squash-merged through PR #65 at
`a5c6c9c41b5d4e80ede1f7045ecfbafdb8b59659` after the final Opus approval. The
21 SQL safety tests remain gated by the unavailable connection string; no
production/provider claim is made. Approved PD-024,
PD-033, PD-035, PD-036, PD-037, PD-040, PD-041, PD-042, PD-043, PD-044, and
PD-046 were consumed only at their exact bounded Master Data, Migration,
Reporting, and Finance-reference positions. Procurement Supplier Confirmation
remains MESP-124.

- resource authorization seams;
- audit/evidence foundation;
- durable-work/outbox concepts;
- persistence safety rules;
- SQL Server validation strategy;
- architecture enforcement;
- safe error boundaries;
- shared module contracts;
- approved Infrastructure persistence path.

## Business backend

Estimated completion:

**~15–20%**

Major remaining areas include:

- complete Product/Master Data;
- Procurement;
- Purchase Orders;
- Supplier Confirmation;
- Goods Receipt;
- Supplier Returns;
- Supplier Invoices;

- migration;
- production integrations.

## Combined backend progress

> **Backend Overall: ~58%**

---

# 8. Database / Persistence Progress

Current estimate:

> **Database / Persistence Overall: ~54%**

## Strong foundation already established

- SQL Server direction;
- Entity Framework architecture;
- Tenant ownership rules;
- module schema ownership;
- migrations policy;
- optimistic concurrency direction;
- provider-backed validation approach;
- cross-module transaction rules;
- module persistence boundaries;
- safe composition path.
- formal local SQL Server migrations for the current Tenancy, Master Data,
  Business Parties, and Procurement contexts;
- verified Development SQLite-to-SQL Server data cutover with preserved IDs,
  Tenant lineage, foreign keys, source hashes, and recoverable backups.

## Major production data model still required

- Product catalog;
- Category/UOM production persistence;
- Suppliers;
- Customer downstream/commercial persistence and production provisioning;
- Price Lists;
- Finance tax posting/history and downstream consumption;
- Currency/Payment Terms downstream production consumption;
- Exchange Rate downstream consumption and production provisioning;
- Procurement documents;
- Inventory ledger;
- Inventory projections/balances;
- Sales documents;
- AR;
- AP;
- Cash/Bank;

- Journals;
- General Ledger;
- Posting entries;
- Financial periods;
- tax history;
- document numbering;
- migration staging;
- reconciliation structures;
- reporting/read models;
- integration state.

Category/UOM, Product identity, Supplier, Customer, Currency, Payment Terms,
and Tax now represent bounded business data-bearing Master Data
implementations; Exchange Rate is now also implemented at its bounded MESP-120
scope. Customer source tables/mappings and the Currency/Payment Terms/Tax/
Exchange Rate tables are present in module-owned contexts, but SQL/provider and
production gates remain open.

- error handling;
- language/i18n foundation;
- reusable shared UI components;
- sign-in surface;
- early Tenant/platform administration surfaces.
- transparent theme-aware generated brand derivatives, shared shell adoption,
  and real browser validation across light/dark, RTL, and collapsed layouts.

## Major frontend work still required

- Remaining Master Data maintenance beyond the shared MESP-117 workspace;
- Product Catalog depth and commercial configuration;
- Supplier and Customer downstream/commercial workflows;

- complete EN/AR;
- complete RTL;
- responsive states;
- loading/error/empty/restricted states;
- permission-aware navigation;
- production UX hardening.

# 10. Historical Delivery Velocity Baseline

Observed recent execution rhythm can produce approximately:

- **3–5 light/bounded planning, review, documentation, or foundation sessions on a heavy active day**, but
- complex ERP implementation slices are materially heavier.

For forecasting, use a normalized velocity of:

> **~1.5–2 production-equivalent bounded sessions per active working day**

This is the default planning velocity until sufficient historical implementation data exists to calculate a better rolling average.

## Velocity update rule

After every 5 completed implementation sessions, calculate:

- sessions completed;
- active working days;
- average sessions/day;
- number of correction sessions;
- implementation vs review ratio;
- average calendar duration per business slice;
- forecast variance.

Update this section if the rolling average changes materially.

# 11. Estimated Remaining Time by Major Area

These estimates assume continuation at approximately the current normalized execution pace.

| Remaining Area | Current Completion | Estimated Active Work |
|---|---:|---:|
| Complete Master Data | 62% | **4–7 days** |
| Procurement / Purchase-to-Pay | 8–10% | **5–8 days** |
| Inventory / Warehouse | 3–5% | **7–10 days** |
| Finance / Accounting | 3–5% | **9–13 days** |
| B2B Sales / Order-to-Cash | 3–5% | **6–9 days** |
| Reporting | 2–3% | **3–5 days** |
| Security / Data Governance completion | 40–45% | **3–5 days** |
| Saudi Localization / internal Tax/VAT engineering | 8–10% | **4–7 days; statutory/external validation remains gated** |
| External integrations | Future-release / not Release 1 production capability | **MESP-39 remains deferred and unactivated** |
| Migration / Tenant Onboarding | 3–5% | **4–7 days** |
| Remaining Angular / Business UI | 15% | **12–18 days** |
| Full End-to-End Integration / Regression | 15–20% | **6–10 days** |
| Performance / Security / Production Hardening | ~15% | **5–8 days** |
| UAT / Cutover / Go-Live Fixes | ~0–10% | **5–10 days** |

These durations are not strictly sequential. Frontend, reporting, hardening, and some integrations can overlap with backend implementation.

# 12. Historical Fast-Track Forecast Baseline

The current milestone is **31 August 2026 — Release 1 Integrated Preview**.
This is a forecast of the maximum safely integrated real codebase, not a
promise to mark the full Release 1 scope complete by that date.

| Window | Optimistic | Realistic | Minimum credible |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 Aug | MESP-120 implemented, reviewed, merged through focused PR #63, and closed in Jira; MESP-121 is the next contract-bound handoff. | One approved capability at a time; Exchange Rate is locally usable without external FX or Finance posting claims. | Real internal Exchange Rate master/reference contract with truthful SQL/provider/production gates and exact MESP-121 TASK handoff. |
| 12 Aug | MESP-115 and MESP-116 synchronized; MESP-117 implemented, reviewed, merged through focused PR #60, and closed in Jira. | One approved capability at a time; MESP-118 remains To Do/not activated and is the exact next handoff. | Shared five-slice Angular workspace, Category/UOM seam, focused validation, closure evidence, and exact MESP-118 TASK handoff are clean; SQL/provider/production gates remain open. |
| 15–22 Aug | Shared Angular/Master Data plus initial Procurement/Inventory spine integrated. | One approved capability at a time, with the first visible Master Data/Procurement path validated. | No unsafe activation; real repository preview path and dependencies are verified. |
| 23–28 Aug | Coherent Procurement+Inventory spine with Finance/Sales foundations and early Opus checkpoint A. | Strongest safely integrated capability, affected tests, auth/audit/localization, and correction work. | Buildable real codebase with truthful pending/blocked/gated list. |
| 29–31 Aug | Broadest safely integrated preview of Master Data, P2P, Inventory, and Finance/Sales foundations. | Running real Release 1 preview with coherent completed slices and an explicit remaining-work map. | Running real codebase preview with no fake UI, no MVP reclassification, and no external integration claim. |
| After preview | Full capability waves continue toward late Sep–mid Oct feature completion if capacity and decisions hold. | Full feature work continues sequentially; serious RC/production readiness remains late Oct–mid Nov and gate-dependent. | Continue only after validated handoffs; do not convert preview status into production readiness. |

The capability plan contains the detailed date-window forecast and the
optimistic/realistic/minimum-credible definitions. Percentages remain based on
usable production capability, not forecast or Jira creation.

# 13. Historical Scenario Forecast (superseded by current fast-track forecast above)

## Aggressive Scenario

Conditions:

- heavy execution pace continues;
- decisions resolved quickly;
- low rework;
- architecture remains stable;
- external Saudi validation does not delay launch;
- production infrastructure is prepared in parallel.

Forecast:

> **8–10 weeks**

Potential production-ready window:

> **Early/Mid October 2026**

This is possible but should not be committed externally yet.

---

## Realistic Scenario

Conditions:

- current normalized execution pace;
- expected review/correction sessions;
- normal ERP complexity;
- some parallel frontend/backend work;
- external validation proceeds without major delay.

Forecast:

> **11–14 weeks**

Target production-ready window:

> **Late October to Mid-November 2026**

This is the recommended management forecast.

---

## Conservative Scenario

Conditions:

- Finance/Inventory redesign;
- accounting rule corrections;
- Saudi compliance delay;
- infrastructure decisions delayed;
- production environment issues;
- material UAT rework;
- migration complexity.

Forecast:

> **14–18 weeks**

Potential completion window:

> **Mid-November to December 2026**

---

# 14. Expected Progress Trajectory

The intended production-readiness curve is:

| Milestone | Expected Overall Completion |
|---|---:|
| Current state after MESP-99 / SL-02 | **27%** |
| Master Data complete | **~40%** |
| Procurement complete | **~43%** |
| Inventory complete | **~52%** |
| Finance complete | **~64%** |
| B2B Sales complete | **~73%** |
| Reporting + Integrations + Saudi Engineering | **~80%** |
| Full Angular UI | **~88%** |
| Migration + Full E2E Integration | **~93%** |
| Performance/Security/Production Deployment Readiness | **~97%** |
| UAT + Saudi/Legal Validation + Migration Rehearsal + Go-Live Evidence | **100%** |

## Important interpretation

The **70–75% milestone** is especially important.

At that point the core transactional ERP engines should exist:

- Master Data;
- Procurement;
- Inventory;
- Finance;
- B2B Sales.

The remaining work from ~75% to 100% is primarily:

- frontend completion;
- reporting;
- integrations;
- Saudi production validation;
- migration;
- security/performance hardening;
- UAT;
- deployment;
- production cutover.

# 16. Current Critical / Production Gates

The following categories remain important production gates and should be continuously tracked.

## Business Decision Gates

- Procurement approval workflow.
- Supplier confirmation rules.
- Purchase matching tolerances.
- inventory tracking scope.
- negative stock.
- customer credit control.
- settlement methods.
- report catalogue.
- multi-currency rate source.
- approval delegation/escalation.

## Production / External Gates

- reference volume assumptions;
- future Saudi Compliance / Integration release scope (MESP-49 Release 1
  disposition is complete);
- Saudi legal/tax validation;
- data residency;
- retention;
- backup/recovery commitments;
- migration source scope;
- final Wafra cutover inputs.

These gates should not prevent unrelated bounded implementation work, but they must be resolved before the dependent production capability is finalized.

The following prior handoff paragraph is retained as historical evidence.

> **No source implementation item is active. MESP-37 is Done through the approved bounded product-only Saudi Localization/Core ERP BRD in docs/28_Release_1_Saudi_Localization_BRD.md, with PR #55 merged to main; MESP-112 is Done through documentation-only PR #54 with the Release 1 Saudi scope overlay and PD-023; MESP-49 is Done for Release 1 scope only; MESP-50 remains open for production/platform governance; MESP-23 remains In Progress as the living Open Questions Register; MESP-107 Customer, MESP-104 Supplier, and MESP-102 Product implementations are complete at their approved bounded scopes. MESP-33 Inventory and MESP-34 Finance are complete as approved documentation-only BRDs through PR #46 and PR #47; MESP-109 Finance reconciliation is Done through PR #50; MESP-35 B2B Sales is Done through PR #51; MESP-36 Reporting and Analytics is Done through PR #52; MESP-111 Saudi regulatory evidence readiness is Done through PR #53 with its historical draft-only verdict preserved; MESP-53, MESP-54, and MESP-110 remain open; MESP-113 remains To Do/unapproved for INV-OD-004; MESP-114 is Done through focused PR #56 for the bounded Pre-MESP-38 reconciliation; the next exact handoff is MESP-38 Security, Audit, and Data Governance BRD only, and it remains To Do and is not activated.**

Current strategic state:

- Foundation architecture is mostly established.
- Tenant isolation and authorization foundations are materially mature.
- Category/UOM, Product identity, Supplier, and Business Customer are now the
  completed bounded data-bearing Master Data slices.
- Master Data lifecycle completion is conservatively estimated at ~62% after
  the bounded Product identity, Supplier, Customer, Currency, Payment Terms,
  Tax, and Exchange Rate implementations; MESP-106 hardening is complete and
  the MESP-120 capability is locally validated without closing
  SQL/provider/production gates.
- The bounded post-merge correction gate is complete before SL-03 readiness:
  - Tenant ownership-verifier EF lookups are truly asynchronous and honor cancellation;
  - `persistence_unavailable` audit evidence is classified as an internal failure rather than authorization denial;
  - `parent_category_not_found` audit evidence is classified as `NotFound`, while depth and cycle hierarchy validation remains unchanged;
  - the two low-risk test-quality findings from PR #33 are cleaned up;
- stale duplicate Jira artifacts MESP-97/MESP-98 are reconciled as superseded historical work.
- MESP-101 completed the Product identity readiness gate through PR #36. Its
  documentation baseline records six Product-only owner bounds, Product-owned
  authorization/audit/concurrency requirements, Tenant isolation, localization
  limits, downstream contracts, and explicit no-source exclusions. This
  documentation did not increase production-capability percentages. MESP-102
  then implemented the bounded Product identity source slice through PR #37 at
  merge `202d59068caac5d1fac402794627e41d7f452456`, with focused Product 8/8
  and non-SQL 602/602 validation; the 21 SQL safety tests remain gated by the
  missing connection string.
- MESP-103 was activated under MESP-6 with Jira evidence `10679`; its
  independent analysis and decision bundle are `10680`, Supplier-only Owner
  disposition is `10681`, and closure is `10682`. MESP-104 is Done through PR
  #39 at merge `721adeb27c366d2b8aedde66d006ac6a49956f99`, with Jira
  activation/validation/closure evidence `10685`/`10686`/`10687`. The bounded
  Supplier source slice is implemented and validated, but the 21 SQL safety
  tests remain gated by the unavailable connection string; no migration,
  provider, or production claim was made. MD-OD-007 remains an external
  Saudi-validation and production gate. MESP-105 is Done with Customer-only
  Owner disposition evidence `10691`; MESP-107 is Done through PR #41 at merge
  `fb632982d06fd4f6bf965fb15dff7701a0bddcec`, with activation/validation/
  closure evidence `10692`/`10726`/`10727`. PR #40 carried the docs-only
  handoff and merged to `main` at
  `aa778038a509ad24ffabcd5d0fbb1824002451df`; the Customer implementation
  remains limited to external B2B identity, Tenant-safe authorization,
  integrity, lifecycle, concurrency, audit, contacts, contracts/routes, and
  module-owned persistence. No statutory/downstream/provider/production claim
  was made.
- MESP-106 is Done through PR #42 for authorization dependency classification,
  deterministic Supplier duplicate audit classification, and failure-evidence
  preservation. Focused classification tests are 82/82, the full non-SQL suite
  is 670/670, and the Release build is 0/0. It does not change
  production-capability percentages; MESP-23 remains the existing In Progress
  governance/open-questions register.
- MESP-33 is Done as the approved documentation-only Inventory and Warehouse
  BRD through PR #46 at merge
  cd6f57de329b7d193c5d75e2e4268ae87c8aac67, with Jira activation/validation/
  approval/closure evidence 10741/10742/10743/10745 and MESP-23 handoff
  10744. Its open decision bundle preserves MESP-41 through MESP-55 except
  MESP-52/MESP-56 at their exact approved scopes. It does not change
  production-capability percentages.
- MESP-34 is Done as the approved documentation-only Finance and Accounting
  BRD through PR #47 at merge
  `a6f1960e9ae748c9809b6addbfd7e8d7ea510a1b`, with Jira activation,
  validation, Owner approval, final validation, and MESP-23 handoff evidence
  `10746`/`10747`/`10748`/`10749`/`10750`. Its FIN-OD-01 through FIN-OD-08
  recommendations remain non-authoritative; MESP-41 through MESP-55 remain
  open except MESP-52/MESP-56, and MESP-48/MESP-49/MESP-50 remain open gates.
  It does not change production-capability percentages.
- MESP-109 is Done as the independent Opus 5 Finance reconciliation through
  PR #50, merged at `cfb17878a0145cb99fc571da211e01dec6a66f28` from reviewed
  head `cf3f6941523551a3d8a0ecdca39256b3e349c6f2`. Its PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING
  FINDINGS verdict preserves MESP-54, MESP-41 through MESP-55, MESP-48,
  MESP-49, and MESP-50 as open/gated and leaves FIN-OD-09 / MESP-110 To Do;
  no source or production-capability behavior was added.
- MESP-23 remains governance-only and does not change production-capability
  percentages: Jira comment `10731` reconciles 16 Jira-decomposed entries,
  14 remaining Open / To Do decisions, and the approved MESP-52/PD-020 and
  MESP-56/PD-021 closures. MESP-48, MESP-49, and MESP-50 remain open
  external/performance/production gates.
- Correction commit `e527f8a0cc32a72cef554e2bd93ab6322e9b1064` merged through PR #34 at
  `35417d35c076d1318474a7e4b31144cc9d94279b`; Jira evidence is comments
  `10667` (MESP-99), `10669` (MESP-97), and `10668` (MESP-98).
- Core ERP transaction engines are still ahead.
- Frontend foundation exists but most ERP business screens remain.
- Production readiness is still dominated by future Finance, Inventory, Sales, Saudi compliance, migration, and end-to-end hardening.

The accepted SHA-256 fingerprint design and persistence-side conflict detection were kept; the defect was ordering in `PurchaseOrderService`, which ran lifecycle/concurrency/approval-stage/policy/delegation/supplier-change/reapproval checks before persisted replay, so identical retries stopped being replayable after the original success advanced state and after the volatile ten-minute REST idempotency cache expired or the API restarted. A bounded read-only probe `IPurchaseOrderPersistence.ProbeReplayAsync` (NotFound/Replay/Conflict) over already-stored Tenant-scoped audit evidence is now called after trusted Tenant context, target resolution, and actor authorization but before state-dependent validation — no schema change, accepted additive migration not rewritten, in-transaction replay check retained as defense in depth, and replay matched on the exact actor so separation of duties and revoked authorization are unaffected. Four new backend regression tests prove durable replay for submit-after-PendingApproval, approve-after-Approved, issue-after-Issued, Rejected-confirmation-after-Rejected, the confirmation that created ChangedPendingApproval, supplier-change approval and rejection after the order left ChangedPendingApproval, and create-after-source-drift, each asserting no duplicate history/audit/confirmation/supplier-change and no second mutation; 409 conflict semantics unchanged. No production-capability percentage change (correction work, not additive scope). Release build 0/0; official backend runner **778/778 passed, 0 skipped** against disposable LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_20260818103729_8fb927af` with zero orphan safety databases and the persistent MESP connection untouched; targeted PurchaseOrderTests/RestFoundationTests **41/41**; backend-only, so Angular **212/212**, build **492.02 kB initial / 72.94 kB PO lazy / 91.94 kB quotation lazy**, and Chromium **15/15** stand unchanged and were not rerun; `npm audit` unchanged at **1 high** (pre-existing `nanoid` advisory; dependency files untouched, `npm audit fix` not run).

Backend Release build passed 0 warnings/0 errors after clearing stale process locks; non-SQL backend regression passed 711/711 (unchanged baseline; 21 SQL safety cases remain gated by unavailable `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING`); frontend tests passed 141/141 (110 pre-existing Phase A/B + 31 new Phase C); production build passed with the import workspace as its own 88.97 kB lazy chunk and a 437.19 kB initial bundle, under the 500 kB budget; `git diff --check` passed. Dev servers were restarted only via the official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1` launcher (MiniERP 5300 / Angular 4300, unrelated RMS 5000 untouched); a full authenticated HTTP-level journey (antiforgery, sign-in, context switch, DryRun `ProductCategory` batch create/simulate, row outcomes) was verified through the Angular proxy using the same facade/service contract the component calls; visual browser verification was not performed (no browser-automation tool available) and is disclosed rather than claimed. PR #65 description updated with the Phase C section; no Jira/tracker write was performed, MESP-123 was not activated, and no production-capability percentage change is claimed for this UI-layer/nonvisual-seam completion; remaining work is GPT-5.6 Sol planner verification then independent Claude Opus 5 review | 31 Aug 2026 Integrated Preview; serious RC/production forecast remains gate-dependent and realistically late Oct-mid Nov 2026 |

# 19. Next Expected Statistical Milestones

Update this table as milestones complete.

| Trigger | Expected Updated Overall Range |
|---|---:|
| Category/UOM SL-02 complete | **✅ Achieved — ~27%** |
| Master Data halfway complete | **30–32%** |
| Master Data complete | **~35%** |
| Procurement complete | **~43%** |
| Inventory complete | **~52%** |
| Finance complete | **~64%** |
| B2B Sales complete | **~73%** |
| Reporting/Integrations/Saudi engineering complete | **~80%** |
| Full Angular Release-1 UI complete | **~88%** |
| Migration + E2E complete | **~93%** |
| Production hardening complete | **~97%** |
| UAT/cutover/compliance evidence complete | **100%** |

These are forecast anchors, not automatic percentage assignments. Actual percentages must be recalculated from delivered scope and evidence.

---

# 20. Reporting Rule

When asked:

> "How far is the project?"

Use the **Overall Production-Ready Completion** number.

When asked:

> "How much Jira work is Done?"

Use raw Jira workflow statistics separately.

When asked:

> "How much backend is done?"

Use **Backend Overall**, not Foundation-only completion.

When asked:

> "Is the project ready?"

Do not answer from percentages alone. Check the 100% Production Ready Definition and critical gates.

# 22. Permanent Principle

The purpose of this file is not to make the project appear more complete.

The purpose is to provide a consistent, conservative, evidence-based answer to:

> **Where are we now, what remains, and when can the complete backend + database + frontend ERP realistically be production ready?**

Progress must always be based on **working, validated, production-capable outcomes** rather than documentation volume, Jira issue count, or model activity.
