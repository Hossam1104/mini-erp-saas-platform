## 1. Purpose and bounded scope

This record reconciles the accepted O5-FIN-001 through O5-FIN-010 findings
against the approved Finance baseline before MESP-35. It does not reopen or
redesign the approved Finance domain. It records the minimum business-boundary
clarifications, glossary reconciliation, traceability repairs, and open
decision governance needed to make the baseline safe to hand off.

The reconciliation adds no application source, test, database, schema,
migration, EF context, endpoint, API contract, UI, provider, infrastructure,
production configuration, or production-capability claim.

## 2. Finding disposition

| Finding | Disposition and evidence | Decision state |
|---|---|---|
| O5-FIN-001 Reporting Currency / MESP-54 | **Accepted and bounded.** The Finance BRD now states that Finance owns the accounting and multi-currency contract, source monetary facts, conversion/rate evidence, and historical applied values. Reporting owns later presentation/report consumption only where approved. Reporting Currency is not consolidation and does not create second books. FIN-OD-04 explicitly includes the Release 1 Reporting Currency choice and conversion/rate-evidence policy. | MESP-54 remains open; no Reporting Currency recommendation is approved. Exchange Rate remains gated. |
| O5-FIN-002 physical event to financial document | **Accepted and bounded.** Goods Receipt remains Inventory-owned. Where approved policy recognizes inventory value before Purchase Invoice, Finance preserves a balanced, visible, source-linked interim effect without AP before invoice. Later invoice clearing/reclassification/reconciliation preserves original history; unmatched and partial balances are visible, aged, attributable, and owned. Customer delivery alone creates no AR/revenue and no unbilled-revenue inference. | Exact accounts, clearing/accrual mappings, valuation, matching, and exception policy remain FIN-OD-01 and the owning open decisions. |
| O5-FIN-003 fiscal-year and year-end handling | **Accepted and bounded.** The Finance BRD now requires a Company/Legal Entity Fiscal Calendar with Fiscal Years and Fiscal Periods, immutable posted history, controlled year-end evidence, and reversal/adjustment/reclose rather than silent rewriting. | Exact closing/carry-forward, retained-earnings/equity, derived-reporting, reopen, and reclose mechanics remain FIN-OD-01 / FIN-OD-09 / MESP-110. |
| O5-FIN-004 Payment Term DoR orphan | **Accepted and bounded.** The glossary and M95-SL-07 now distinguish the approved Payment Term concept from the unresolved Release 1 term shape: base date, interval versus schedule/installments, early discount, due-date/aging/settlement ownership, and historical preservation. Master Data owns identity/lifecycle; Finance owns the transaction/accounting contract. | FIN-OD-09 / MESP-110 remains To Do and unapproved; M95-SL-07 is not Ready until the contract is decided. |
| O5-FIN-005 Finance glossary reconciliation | **Accepted.** Cost Center, Fiscal Calendar, Fiscal Period, Payment Terms, Journal, Posting Rule, Allocation, and Settlement are promoted only as concepts evidenced by the Finance BRD. Their remaining implementation detail points to a named open gate rather than closed MESP-34. Rounding Difference remains Requires Business Decision because MESP-54 governs unresolved conversion, precision, and treatment. | No blanket promotion and no circular `subject to MESP-34 confirmation` language remains for these terms. |
| O5-FIN-006 Inventory posting-matrix rows | **Accepted and bounded.** Finance now has boundary rows for Warehouse Transfer, Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count variance, and Stock Issue. Inventory owns physical movement/evidence; Finance interprets only approved value-affecting handoffs. Same-boundary transfer is not revenue/AP/AR, and delivery/issue does not invent revenue. | Inventory valuation, negative stock, landed cost, count/write-off, transfer variance, tracking, and backdating decisions remain open. |
| O5-FIN-007 internal cross references | **Accepted.** Finance BRD references to the decision table now use section 22.1, and a focused reference check is part of validation. | No domain decision changed. |
| O5-FIN-008 approval and closure evidence | **Accepted.** The stale post-merge placeholder is replaced with the actual historical MESP-34 PR #47 merge and Jira closure evidence. MESP-109 carries its own focused correction PR and closure record. | History is preserved accurately; MESP-34 remains Done. |
| O5-FIN-009 ADR traceability | **Accepted.** Finance now names ADR-010 for telemetry/exporter access and operational-data retention, ADR-015 for the Saudi e-invoicing adapter and credential boundary after MESP-49 validation, and ADR-017 for approved-integration-only external partner/API authentication. | ADR decisions are not changed or promoted by this record. |
| O5-FIN-010 stale delivery-plan line | **Accepted.** Current-state wording in the Product Delivery Master Plan is corrected only for the stale MESP-93/MESP-94 assertion; older overlays remain explicitly historical. | No foundation scope or implementation item is activated. |

## 3. Preserved gates and handoff

- MESP-34 remains historically Done as the approved Finance BRD baseline.
- MESP-35 remains To Do and is not activated by this reconciliation.
- MESP-23 remains the living open-questions and decision-register governance
  item. FIN-OD-09 / MESP-110 is an additional open Finance detail bundle; it
  does not close or rewrite MESP-41 through MESP-56.
- MESP-41, MESP-42, MESP-43, MESP-44, MESP-45, MESP-46, MESP-47, MESP-48,
  MESP-49, MESP-50, MESP-51, MESP-53, MESP-54, and MESP-55 remain open.
  MESP-52 / PD-020 and MESP-56 / PD-021 retain their exact approved scopes.
- MESP-48 supported-volume/performance and MESP-50 retention, privacy, legal
  hold, purge, residency, backup, and restoration gates remain unchanged.
- Release 1 remains B2B ERP only. Retail POS and Wafra-specific core behavior
  remain excluded.

## 4. Currency conclusion

M95-SL-06 Currency is conceptually Ready for a future, separately authorized
readiness/implementation path after this contract reconciliation. The Finance
contract supplies functional/base and transaction/document currency roles and
historical monetary evidence. Reporting Currency remains explicit MESP-54
scope and is not approved here.

This session does not execute Currency, create master-data persistence, or
claim Exchange Rate Ready. M95-SL-09 Exchange Rate remains gated by MESP-54
source, provenance, approval, conversion, rounding, revaluation, and Finance
posting-contract decisions.

## 5. Validation and completion evidence

The implementation session must record the focused PR number, reviewed head,
merge SHA, final synchronized `main` SHA, Jira validation/closure comments,
and the MESP-23 handoff here after the documentation diff is reviewed and
merged. Until those values are recorded, MESP-109 remains In Progress.

The repository validation must confirm:

- `git diff --check` passes;
- all ten findings have the dispositions above;
- `MESP-54`, `MESP-110`, and the Exchange Rate gate remain open;
- no source, test, schema, migration, EF, endpoint, UI, provider,
  infrastructure, or production configuration file changed;
- the Finance BRD contains no stale section-23 decision-table reference;
- MESP-34 is Done, MESP-35 is To Do, and MESP-23 is In Progress in live Jira;
- production-capability percentages remain unchanged; and
- the root `TASK.md` contains the complete exact MESP-35 fresh-session prompt
  and this session does not execute it.
