| **Source baseline** | `MiniERPSaaSPlatform_PRD_v1.2.docx` — PRD v1.2, Final Approved Baseline, approved 31 July 2026 |
| **Status** | Draft — ready for Product Owner and Business Owner review |
| **Prepared** | 31 July 2026 |

## Purpose

This glossary is the mandatory vocabulary for every Business Requirements Document produced for the Mini ERP SaaS Platform. Every domain BRD (MESP-27 … MESP-40), every business rule, every acceptance scenario, and every future implementation Story must use these terms with these meanings. Where a term is ambiguous in everyday usage, this glossary states explicitly what the term **is not**.

## How to read an entry

Each entry carries eight fields:

- **Approved definition** — the binding definition.
- **Business meaning** — why the concept exists in business terms.
- **What it is not** — the boundary that prevents misuse.
- **Owning module** — the single domain accountable for the definition.
- **Related entities or documents** — what it connects to.
- **Example** — a concrete illustration.
- **Approval status** — one of the three values below.
- **Source** — where the definition comes from.

## Approval status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Approved Product Baseline** | Fixed by PRD v1.2 or by the approved decision list recorded in MESP-16. Must not be reopened during BRD work. |
| **Draft for BRD Validation** | Standard ERP meaning proposed by business analysis. Requires confirmation in the relevant BRD workshop. Not a product decision. |
| **Requires Business Decision** | Cannot be finalised until a named open decision (MESP-41 … MESP-56) is answered with approved evidence. |

## Scope statement

This glossary does **not** answer any open decision. Where a term depends on an unresolved decision, the entry names the Jira decision Task and stops there. No unresolved business rule has been invented, and no Wafra-specific vocabulary has been introduced.

# 1. SaaS and Organization

## Platform

**Approved definition:** The single cloud-native, multi-tenant software service that hosts and operates the Mini ERP product for all tenants.

**Business meaning:** The commercial and technical entity that the Platform Owner runs and sells subscriptions to. It is the outermost level of the approved hierarchy: Platform → Tenant → Company / Legal Entity → Branch → Warehouse.

**What it is not:** Not a customer's installation. Not a per-customer deployment. Not a synonym for Tenant. Not an on-premise product.

**Owning module:** SaaS Platform Administration.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant, Subscription, Plan, Module, Entitlement, Country Pack.

**Example:** The Mini ERP SaaS Platform serves Wafra as Tenant #1 while remaining a generic multi-tenant product.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — multi-tenant SaaS product definition; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Platform Owner

**Approved definition:** The organization that owns, operates, sells, and governs the Platform, and the internal roles acting on its behalf.

**Business meaning:** Accountable for tenant provisioning, subscription plans, entitlements, platform-wide configuration, release management, and platform-level support.

**What it is not:** Not a Tenant Administrator. Not a business customer of a tenant. The Platform Owner does not own tenant business data and must not act inside tenant data without an authorized, audited support mechanism.

**Owning module:** SaaS Platform Administration.

**Related entities or documents:** Platform, Tenant, Subscription, Audit Event.

**Example:** The Platform Owner creates a new tenant, assigns the subscription plan, and hands the Tenant Administrator role to the customer.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — platform administration scope (PLT / ADM requirement families).

## Tenant

**Approved definition:** An isolated customer subscription boundary on the Platform that owns its own users, master data, transactions, configuration, and reports.

**Business meaning:** The unit of commercial subscription and the primary unit of data isolation. All tenant business data is segregated so that no tenant can read or affect another tenant's data.

**What it is not:** Not a Company. A Tenant may contain one or many Companies. Not a Branch. Not a user. Not a database concept exposed to business users. Not the Platform.

**Owning module:** Multi-Tenancy.

**Related entities or documents:** Platform, Company / Legal Entity, Subscription, Tenant Administrator, Tenant Membership, Country Pack.

**Example:** Wafra is Tenant #1. A second, unrelated SME onboarded later is a separate Tenant with completely separate data.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — multi-tenancy and organization hierarchy; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Tenant Administrator

**Approved definition:** The role inside a Tenant that is accountable for that tenant's companies, branches, warehouses, users, roles, permissions, and tenant-level configuration.

**Business meaning:** The customer-side owner of the tenant. Grants and revokes access, defines the organization structure, and approves tenant configuration.

**What it is not:** Not the Platform Owner. Cannot change subscription plans or entitlements that are controlled by the Platform Owner. Not automatically an approver of business documents — that is granted through Role and Permission.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant, User, Tenant Membership, Role, Permission, Entitlement.

**Example:** The Wafra Tenant Administrator creates the Riyadh branch, adds a purchasing user, and assigns the Purchasing role.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — identity, access, and tenant administration requirements.

## Subscription

**Approved definition:** The effective-dated commercial agreement that links a Tenant to a versioned Plan for a defined period and determines the Entitlements and limits available to that Tenant.

**Business meaning:** Selects the approved Plan version and dates from which its Entitlements apply. Release 1 assignment is manual and audited; Subscription metadata does not calculate a charge or create a subscription invoice, payment, or accounting transaction.

**What it is not:** Not a Sales Order or Sales Invoice in the tenant's ERP data, not a Trial, and not a direct Entitlement override. An Entitlement change requires a versioned Plan change or an effective-dated Subscription change.

**Owning module:** SaaS Platform Administration.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant, Plan, Entitlement, Module.

**Example:** Tenant #1 holds an active subscription to the standard plan covering Procurement, Inventory, Sales, and Finance.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — subscription and plan requirements; MESP-52 decision approved by Hossam on 1 August 2026 and specified in MESP-27 BRD v0.10.

## Plan

**Approved definition:** A named, reusable, versioned commercial package that defines Modules, features, configurable limits, service/support tier, non-calculating price metadata, and effective dates.

**Business meaning:** Standardises what the Platform Owner makes available. Release 1 has one production Plan containing all approved B2B ERP Modules. A separate Restricted Validation Plan exists only in non-production to prove Entitlement denial and cannot be sold, assigned in production, or treated as a Trial.

**What it is not:** Not a per-Tenant customization, Trial offering, Role, Permission, pricing engine, invoice, payment, or accounting transaction. Price metadata is descriptive and non-calculating. A Plan governs what is *available*; Roles and Permissions govern what a *User* may do.

**Owning module:** SaaS Platform Administration.

**Related entities or documents:** Subscription, Entitlement, Module, Tenant.

**Example:** The production Release 1 Plan enables all approved B2B ERP Modules, carries a named support tier and price metadata, and excludes Retail POS.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — subscription and plan requirements; MESP-52 decision approved by Hossam on 1 August 2026 and specified in MESP-27 BRD v0.10.

## Entitlement

**Approved definition:** The effective, evaluated right of a Tenant to use a specific Module, feature, or capacity, derived from its Subscription and Plan.

**Business meaning:** The evaluated answer to "is this capability available to this Tenant now?" — a commercial gate derived from the effective Plan and Subscription, not a security Permission.

**What it is not:** **Not a Permission and not a per-Tenant override.** Entitlement is commercial and Tenant-wide; Permission is security and User-specific. Entitlement changes use a versioned Plan or effective-dated Subscription change. A security or safety restriction may temporarily block an Entitlement but cannot grant an unapproved one. See clarification 18.

**Owning module:** SaaS Platform Administration.

**Related entities or documents:** Subscription, Plan, Module, Permission, Tenant.

**Example:** A tenant is entitled to the Inventory module; within it, only users holding the stock-adjustment permission may post an adjustment.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — entitlement model; MESP-52 decision approved by Hossam on 1 August 2026 and specified in MESP-27 BRD v0.10.

## Module

**Approved definition:** A cohesive functional area of the ERP product with its own business capabilities, data, rules, and reports — for example Procurement, Inventory, Finance, B2B Sales.

**Business meaning:** The unit of product packaging, BRD authorship, and business ownership. Each glossary term has exactly one owning module.

**What it is not:** Not a microservice. The approved architecture baseline is a Modular Monolith, so a Module is a business and code boundary inside one deployable, not a separately deployed service.

**Owning module:** Product Governance.

**Related entities or documents:** Plan, Entitlement, Jira Epic, BRD Task.

**Example:** The Procurement module owns Purchase Request, Purchase Order, Goods Receipt, and Purchase Invoice.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — modular monolith architecture baseline; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Company

**Approved definition:** An operating business unit inside a Tenant that owns its own chart of accounts, fiscal calendar, accounting books, and business documents.

**Business meaning:** The legal and accounting boundary. A Tenant may contain multiple Companies / Legal Entities, each with its own books and financial statements.

**What it is not:** Not a Tenant — a Tenant may hold several Companies. Not a Branch, Department, or Cost Center. Multiple Companies do not imply financial consolidation, intercompany automation, elimination entries, transfer pricing, or consolidated statements in Release 1.

**Owning module:** Organization Structure.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant, Legal Entity, Branch, Chart of Accounts, Fiscal Calendar, General Ledger.

**Example:** A tenant operating two legally separate businesses holds two Companies, each with its own books.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — organization hierarchy; approved decision list (MESP-16); MESP-56 decision approved by Hossam on 1 August 2026. Detailed operating rules remain in MESP-30.

## Legal Entity

**Approved definition:** The legally registered identity of a Company, carrying its registration identifiers, tax identifiers, legal name, and statutory reporting obligations.

**Business meaning:** Determines who is legally liable, which accounting boundary and tax registration apply, and what appears on legally binding documents. One Tenant may contain multiple Legal Entities.

**What it is not:** Not a Branch. Not a separate hierarchy level — Company and Legal Entity are the same level of the approved hierarchy. Release 1 does not provide financial consolidation, intercompany automation, elimination entries, transfer pricing, or consolidated statements.

**Owning module:** Organization Structure.

**Related entities or documents:** Company, Country Pack, Tax Category, Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice.

**Example:** A Saudi legal entity with its own commercial registration and VAT registration number printed on every tax invoice it issues.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — legal entity requirements; MESP-56 decision approved by Hossam on 1 August 2026. Detailed operating rules remain in MESP-30.

## Branch

**Approved definition:** An operational location or business unit belonging to a Company, used to organise operations, responsibility, and reporting below Company level.

**Business meaning:** Where business activity is performed and attributed. Documents are normally raised in the context of a Branch.

**What it is not:** **Not a Warehouse.** A Branch is an operational and organizational unit; a Warehouse is a physical stock-holding location. A Branch may have several Warehouses, and a Warehouse belongs to exactly one Branch. A Branch is also not a Legal Entity and does not issue statutory financial statements of its own.

**Owning module:** Organization Structure.

**Related entities or documents:** Company, Warehouse, Department, Cost Center, business documents.

**Example:** The Riyadh branch of a company, holding a main warehouse and a returns warehouse.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — organization hierarchy; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Warehouse

**Approved definition:** A physical or logical location belonging to a Branch where stock is held and where stock quantities and values are maintained.

**Business meaning:** The lowest level of the approved organization hierarchy and the level at which stock balances are meaningful. Every stock movement names a source warehouse, a destination warehouse, or both.

**What it is not:** Not a Branch. Not a Company. Not an accounting entity — a Warehouse does not have its own chart of accounts. Not a bin or shelf location unless bin-level tracking is later approved.

**Owning module:** Inventory.

**Related entities or documents:** Branch, Stock Balance, Stock Movement, Goods Receipt, Warehouse Transfer, Inventory Count.

**Example:** The Riyadh main warehouse holding 400 units of an item, and the Riyadh returns warehouse holding 12 units of the same item.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — organization hierarchy and inventory model; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Department

**Approved definition:** An internal organizational grouping used to attribute responsibility and, where enabled, cost.

**Business meaning:** Supports "who asked for this" and "who is responsible for this spend", most visibly on Purchase Requests.

**What it is not:** Not a Branch. Not a Cost Center, although a Department may be mapped to one. Not a security boundary — access is controlled by Role, Permission, and Access Scope.

**Owning module:** Organization Structure.

**Related entities or documents:** Branch, Cost Center, Purchase Request, Employee.

**Example:** The Maintenance department raises a purchase request for spare parts.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice. Requires confirmation in the Organization and Company Structure BRD (MESP-30).

## Cost Center

**Approved definition:** A financial reporting dimension used to accumulate costs for a defined area of responsibility.

**Business meaning:** Enables cost reporting below account level without creating additional general ledger accounts.

**What it is not:** Not a Department, although the two are frequently aligned. Not a Branch. Not a Company. Not a profit centre, and not a project.

**Owning module:** Finance and Accounting.

**Related entities or documents:** Journal Entry, Department, Chart of Accounts, Purchase Invoice.

**Example:** Maintenance costs posted to the maintenance cost center while sitting in a single expense account.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice. Requires confirmation in the Finance and Accounting BRD (MESP-34).

## Fiscal Calendar

**Approved definition:** The definition of a Company's financial year and the Fiscal Periods within it.

**Business meaning:** Determines which period a posting falls into and when a period may be closed so that results become final.

**What it is not:** Not the Gregorian or Hijri calendar used for display. Not a tax filing calendar, although the two may align.

**Owning module:** Finance and Accounting.

**Related entities or documents:** Company, Fiscal Period, Posting, Journal Entry.

**Example:** A financial year running January to December with twelve monthly periods.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — finance foundation. Period structure requires confirmation in the Finance and Accounting BRD (MESP-34).

## Fiscal Period

**Approved definition:** A bounded date range inside a Fiscal Calendar into which financial transactions are posted, and which can be open or closed.

**Business meaning:** The control that stops results changing after they have been reported. Once a period is closed, corrections are made by Reversal in an open period, never by editing history.

**What it is not:** Not a document status. Not a reporting filter alone — it enforces posting control. Closing a period is not the same as closing a document.

**Owning module:** Finance and Accounting.

**Related entities or documents:** Fiscal Calendar, Posting, Journal Entry, Reversal, Closed.

**Example:** July is closed, so a July correction is posted as a reversal dated in August.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice aligned to PRD v1.2 posting principles. Requires confirmation in MESP-34.

## Country Pack

**Approved definition:** A reusable set of country-specific configuration, rules, tax behaviour, document formats, and compliance requirements applied to a Company operating in that country.

**Business meaning:** Keeps localisation out of the core product. Saudi Arabia is the initial launch market, so the Saudi Country Pack carries VAT behaviour, Arabic and English document requirements, and e-invoicing obligations.

**What it is not:** Not tenant customisation. Not Wafra-specific configuration. A Country Pack is generic to every tenant operating in that country and must never encode one customer's preferences.

**Owning module:** Saudi Country Pack.

**Related entities or documents:** Legal Entity, Tax Category, Sales Invoice, Base Currency, compliance reporting.

**Example:** The Saudi Country Pack setting SAR as base currency, applying Saudi VAT treatment, and requiring bilingual invoice output.

**Approval status:** Requires Business Decision

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — Saudi localization requirements (KSA family). E-invoicing launch scope is open in **MESP-49 — Confirm Saudi e-invoicing launch scope**.

---

# 2. Identity and Access

## User

**Approved definition:** An authenticated identity that can sign in to the Platform and act inside one or more Tenants according to granted Roles and Permissions.

**Business meaning:** The actor recorded on every business action for accountability and audit.

**What it is not:** **Not an Employee.** A User is a login identity; an Employee is an HR record. Not every employee is a user, and a user may not be an employee (for example an external accountant). A Supplier is never a User in Release 1.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant Membership, Role, Permission, Audit Event, Employee.

**Example:** A purchasing officer signs in as a user and creates a Purchase Order; the audit trail records that user, not a department.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — identity and access requirements; approved decision list (MESP-16).

## Employee

**Approved definition:** A person recorded as working for a Company, used for business attribution such as requester, buyer, salesperson, or approver reference.

**Business meaning:** Lets the business express "who in the organization is this about" independently of who logged in.

**What it is not:** Not a User. Not a login. Not a full HR module — payroll, contracts, leave, and performance are out of scope for Release 1.

**Owning module:** Organization Structure.

**Related entities or documents:** User, Department, Branch, Purchase Request, Sales Order.

**Example:** A purchase request records the requesting employee, while the audit trail records the user who entered it.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice. Employee scope requires confirmation in MESP-30. No HR scope is implied.

## Tenant Membership

**Approved definition:** The link that grants a User access to a specific Tenant, together with the roles and access scope that apply within that Tenant.

**Business meaning:** Makes multi-tenant access explicit and revocable. Removing the membership removes all access to that tenant's data without deleting the user identity.

**What it is not:** Not a Role by itself. Not a Subscription. Not a permission grant on its own.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** User, Tenant, Role, Access Scope, Audit Event.

**Example:** An external accountant holds memberships in two tenants and sees only the data of the tenant currently in context.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — tenant isolation and access requirements.

## Role

**Approved definition:** A named, reusable bundle of Permissions assigned to Users to express a job function.

**Business meaning:** Keeps access administration manageable and consistent. Access is granted by job function, not by individual capability.

**What it is not:** Not a job title. Not an Employee. Not an approval authority by itself — approval authority is an explicit permission with limits, defined in the governance model.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Permission, User, Tenant Membership, Separation of Duties, Approver.

**Example:** A Purchasing role bundling the create-purchase-request, create-purchase-order, and record-supplier-confirmation permissions.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — role-based access control requirements.

## Permission

**Approved definition:** The atomic right to perform a specific action on a specific object type, such as create, read, update, submit, approve, post, reverse, or cancel.

**Business meaning:** The security control that determines whether a user may perform an action.

**What it is not:** **Not an Entitlement.** Permission is per user and enforces security; Entitlement is per tenant and enforces commercial packaging. Both must allow an action for it to succeed. See clarification 18.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Role, User, Entitlement, Access Scope, Separation of Duties.

**Example:** Post Goods Receipt is a distinct permission from Create Goods Receipt.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — permission model requirements.

## Access Scope

**Approved definition:** The data boundary within which a User's permissions apply — for example a specific Company, Branch, or Warehouse.

**Business meaning:** Two users may hold the same role yet see and act on different data because their scopes differ.

**What it is not:** Not a Permission. Not a Role. Not a report filter — it is enforced, not cosmetic.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Tenant Membership, Role, Permission, Company, Branch, Warehouse.

**Example:** A storekeeper holds the goods-receipt permission scoped to the Riyadh warehouse only.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — access control requirements. Scope granularity requires confirmation in the Identity and Access BRD (MESP-28).

## Separation of Duties

**Approved definition:** The control that prevents one User from performing two conflicting steps of the same business transaction.

**Business meaning:** Reduces fraud and error risk — for example the person who creates a purchase order should not be the sole approver, and the person who receives goods should not also release the supplier payment.

**What it is not:** Not the same as an approval workflow. An approval workflow defines *who signs*; separation of duties defines *who must not sign* because of a conflicting prior action.

**Owning module:** Security and Audit.

**Related entities or documents:** Role, Permission, Approval, Approver, Audit Event.

**Example:** The user who posted the goods receipt is blocked from approving the matching purchase invoice.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — control and audit requirements. Specific conflict pairs require confirmation in the Security, Audit, and Data Governance BRD (MESP-38).

## Approval

**Approved definition:** A recorded business authorisation that allows a document to move from a submitted state to an authorised state.

**Business meaning:** Evidence that an accountable person agreed to the transaction, retained for audit.

**What it is not:** **Not Posting.** Approval is a business authorisation; Posting is the accounting or inventory effect. A document may be approved and not yet posted. See clarification 15.

**Owning module:** Product Governance, applied by every transactional module.

**Related entities or documents:** Approver, Document Status, Submitted, Approved, Audit Event, Separation of Duties.

**Example:** A purchase order above a threshold is approved by a manager before it is issued to the supplier.

**Approval status:** Requires Business Decision

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — approval requirements. Workflow thresholds and levels are open in **MESP-42**; delegation and escalation are open in **MESP-55**.

## Approver

**Approved definition:** A User authorised to grant or refuse an Approval for a defined document type within defined limits.

**Business meaning:** Names accountability for authorising business commitments and spend.

**What it is not:** Not automatically a Tenant Administrator. Not a document owner. Not a reviewer — a reviewer comments, an approver authorises.

**Owning module:** Identity and Access.

**Related entities or documents:** Approval, Role, Permission, Separation of Duties.

**Example:** A branch manager approving purchase orders up to an agreed value limit.

**Approval status:** Requires Business Decision

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — approval requirements. Approval limits, delegation, escalation, and out-of-office behaviour are open in **MESP-55**.

## Audit Event

**Approved definition:** An immutable record of a significant action, capturing who performed it, what changed, when, in which tenant and company context, and from what source document.

**Business meaning:** The evidence base for control, dispute resolution, and compliance review.

**What it is not:** Not an application log for engineers. Not a report. Not editable or deletable by tenant users.

**Owning module:** Security and Audit.

**Related entities or documents:** User, Business Document, Immutable Record, Correlation Identifier.

**Example:** An audit event recording that a specific user posted a stock adjustment of minus 5 units with a stated reason.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — audit and traceability requirements. Retention period is open in **MESP-50 — Confirm tenant data residency and retention policy**.

---

# 3. Business Parties

## Supplier

**Approved definition:** An external business party from whom a Company procures goods or services, recorded as master data inside a Tenant.

**Business meaning:** The counterparty in the Purchase-to-Pay lifecycle and the holder of a payable balance.

**What it is not:** **Not a system User.** Suppliers do not log in, do not receive system accounts, and do not enter data. Not a Tenant — a supplier is business master data belonging to one tenant, not a subscriber to the Platform. Not a Business Customer, although the same legal company may exist as both records.

**Owning module:** Procurement.

**Related entities or documents:** Supplier Contact, Purchase Order, Goods Receipt, Purchase Invoice, Supplier Payment, Accounts Payable, Payment Terms.

**Example:** A parts distributor is recorded as a supplier; its confirmation of a purchase order is typed in by an authorized purchasing user.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2; approved decision list (MESP-16) — suppliers are external business parties and are not system users, and supplier responses are manually recorded by authorized purchasing users.

## Supplier Contact

**Approved definition:** A named person at a Supplier, recorded for communication and document correspondence.

**Business meaning:** Identifies who was dealt with when an order was placed or a confirmation received.

**What it is not:** Not a User. Not an Employee. Recording a contact grants no system access whatsoever.

**Owning module:** Procurement.

**Related entities or documents:** Supplier, Purchase Order, Supplier Confirmation.

**Example:** The supplier's sales representative whose emailed confirmation is recorded against the purchase order by a purchasing user.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — supplier master data requirements.

## Business Customer

**Approved definition:** An external business party to whom a Company sells goods or services under B2B terms, recorded as master data inside a Tenant.

**Business meaning:** The counterparty in the Order-to-Cash lifecycle, holding a receivable balance and, where approved, credit terms and limits.

**What it is not:** **Not a Platform Customer.** A Business Customer is the tenant's customer; a Platform Customer is the Tenant itself, which subscribes to the Platform. Not an anonymous retail consumer — retail consumers belong to Retail POS, which is excluded from Release 1. Not a User.

**Owning module:** B2B Sales.

**Related entities or documents:** Customer Contact, Quotation, Sales Order, Delivery, Sales Invoice, Customer Receipt, Accounts Receivable, Credit Limit.

**Example:** A contracting company that orders on account with 30-day payment terms and an approved credit limit.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — B2B sales scope; approved decision list (MESP-16) — Release 1 supports B2B ERP operations only.

## Customer Contact

**Approved definition:** A named person at a Business Customer, recorded for communication and document correspondence.

**Business meaning:** Identifies who placed or confirmed an order on the customer side.

**What it is not:** Not a User. Not a portal login — no customer self-service access is in Release 1 scope.

**Owning module:** B2B Sales.

**Related entities or documents:** Business Customer, Quotation, Sales Order, Delivery.

**Example:** The customer's procurement officer named on the sales order.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice. Requires confirmation in the B2B Sales BRD (MESP-35).

## Payment Terms

**Approved definition:** The agreed rules that determine when an invoice becomes due, expressed as a defined interval or schedule from an agreed base date.

**Business meaning:** Drives due dates, ageing, collection activity, and cash forecasting on both the payable and receivable sides.

**What it is not:** Not a Credit Limit — terms govern *when* payment is due, a credit limit governs *how much* exposure is allowed. Not a payment method. Not a discount scheme unless early-settlement discounts are separately approved.

**Owning module:** Finance and Accounting.

**Related entities or documents:** Supplier, Business Customer, Purchase Invoice, Sales Invoice, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable.

**Example:** Net 30 days from invoice date.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — finance requirements. Term structures require confirmation in MESP-34.

## Credit Limit

**Approved definition:** The maximum outstanding exposure permitted for a Business Customer before further orders require authorisation or are blocked.

**Business meaning:** Controls the risk of selling on account to a customer who has not paid.

**What it is not:** Not Payment Terms. Not Credit Exposure — the limit is the ceiling, the exposure is the current usage against it.

**Owning module:** Finance and Accounting.

**Related entities or documents:** Business Customer, Credit Exposure, Sales Order, Accounts Receivable, Approval.

**Example:** A customer with a defined limit whose new order requires authorisation because the limit would be exceeded.

**Approval status:** Requires Business Decision

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — credit control requirement. Enforcement points, blocking versus warning, and override authority are open in **MESP-46 — Confirm B2B customer credit-control policy**.

---

# 4. Product and Catalog

## Product

**Approved definition:** A catalogued good or service that a Company can buy, sell, or hold, defined once as master data and reused across all transactions.

**Business meaning:** The definition of *what* a thing is — its description, category, units, tax treatment, and whether it is stock-tracked.

**What it is not:** **Not Stock.** A product is a definition; stock is a quantity of that product held in a warehouse at a point in time. A product with zero stock still exists. See clarification 7.

**Owning module:** Master Data and Catalog.

**Related entities or documents:** Item, SKU, Category, Unit of Measure, Price List, Tax Category, Stock Balance.

**Example:** A 20 mm copper fitting exists as a product whether or not any unit is currently in a warehouse.

**Approval status:** Approved Product Baseline

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — master data and catalog requirements.

## Item

**Approved definition:** The transactable form of a Product used on business documents and in the stock ledger.

**Business meaning:** What is actually ordered, received, issued, sold, and valued.

**What it is not:** Not a document line by itself. Not a Batch or Serial Number, which identify specific instances of an item. In Release 1, Product and Item are used as one concept unless variant handling is separately approved.

**Owning module:** Master Data and Catalog.

**Related entities or documents:** Product, SKU, Stock Movement, Purchase Order line, Goods Receipt Line.

**Example:** The item appearing on a goods receipt line with an accepted quantity of 100.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** PRD v1.2 — catalog requirements. Product-versus-variant modelling requires confirmation in the Master Data and Product Catalog BRD (MESP-31).

## SKU

**Approved definition:** The unique, stable identifier used by the Company to reference a specific sellable and stockable item.

**Business meaning:** The single code everyone uses to mean the same thing across procurement, inventory, sales, and reporting.

**What it is not:** Not a Barcode. Not a supplier's own part number. Not a batch or serial identifier.

**Owning module:** Master Data and Catalog.

**Related entities or documents:** Product, Item, Barcode, Stock Balance.

**Example:** An internal SKU printed on the stock count sheet.

**Approval status:** Draft for BRD Validation

**Source:** Standard ERP practice. Coding rules require confirmation in MESP-31.

## Barcode

**Approved definition:** A scannable code mapped to an Item, used to identify it during physical handling.

**Business meaning:** Speeds and de-risks receiving, transfer, counting, and picking.

**What it is not:** Not the SKU, although it may carry the same value. Not proof of ownership or stock. An item may have several barcodes, including supplier and manufacturer codes.

**Owning module:** Master Data and Catalog.

# 10. Required clarifications

These nineteen distinctions are the terms most often confused in ERP discussions. Every BRD, business rule, and acceptance scenario must respect them.

### 1. Tenant versus Company

A **Tenant** is the subscription and data-isolation boundary on the Platform. A **Company** is an operating and accounting entity inside a Tenant. One Tenant may contain several Companies; a Company never spans Tenants. Subscriptions, entitlements, and tenant isolation are Tenant concepts. Chart of accounts, fiscal calendar, and financial statements are Company concepts.

### 2. Company versus Branch

A **Company** owns the books and produces financial statements. A **Branch** is an operational location inside a Company used to organise activity and responsibility. A Branch has no separate chart of accounts and issues no statutory financial statements.

### 3. Branch versus Warehouse

A **Branch** is an organizational and operational unit. A **Warehouse** is a stock-holding location belonging to exactly one Branch. Stock balances exist at Warehouse level, never at Branch level directly. A Branch may hold several Warehouses.

### 4. User versus Employee

A **User** is a login identity that acts in the system and is recorded in the audit trail. An **Employee** is a person recorded as working for the Company, used for business attribution such as requester or salesperson. Not every employee is a user, and not every user is an employee. Access is granted to Users, never to Employees.

### 5. Supplier versus Tenant

A **Supplier** is external business master data belonging to one Tenant, and is never a system user. A **Tenant** is a paying subscriber to the Platform with its own users and data. A supplier does not log in, does not enter data, and has no visibility of tenant data. Supplier responses are manually recorded by authorized purchasing users.

### 6. Business Customer versus Platform Customer

A **Business Customer** is the tenant's own customer, recorded as master data and party to the Order-to-Cash lifecycle. A **Platform Customer** is the Tenant itself, which subscribes to the Platform under a Plan. Sales Invoices are issued to Business Customers by the tenant; Subscriptions are agreed between the Platform Owner and the Tenant. The two must never appear in the same requirement without being named explicitly.

### 7. Product versus Stock

A **Product** is a catalog definition — what a thing is. **Stock** is a quantity of that product held in a Warehouse at a point in time, with a value. A product exists with zero stock. Creating a product creates no stock. Only a posted inventory document creates stock.

### 8. Purchase Order versus Goods Receipt

A **Purchase Order** is a commitment to a Supplier. **A Purchase Order does not increase stock.** A **Goods Receipt** records physical arrival and acceptance, and **stock increases only through a posted Goods Receipt or another authorized inventory-in document.** An order creates an expected and outstanding position; a receipt creates a stock movement.

### 9. Goods Receipt versus Purchase Invoice

A **Goods Receipt** is the physical event: goods arrived, stock increased. A **Purchase Invoice** is the financial event: the supplier claims payment and a liability is created in Accounts Payable. **A Purchase Invoice does not independently increase stock.** The two are matched, not merged.

### 10. Purchase Invoice versus Supplier Payment

A **Purchase Invoice** creates the obligation to pay. A **Supplier Payment** discharges it and reduces Accounts Payable. Approving an invoice is not paying it. An unpaid approved invoice is a liability, not a settled transaction.

### 11. Sales Order versus Delivery

A **Sales Order** is the commitment to supply a Business Customer; it may reserve stock but does not reduce it. A **Delivery** records goods physically leaving the Warehouse and reduces stock. An order is a promise; a delivery is a movement.

### 12. Delivery versus Sales Invoice

A **Delivery** moves goods and reduces stock. A **Sales Invoice** creates the receivable, recognises revenue and output tax, and is the statutory tax document in Saudi Arabia. Delivering is not invoicing, and invoicing is not delivering.

### 13. Sales Invoice versus Customer Receipt

A **Sales Invoice** creates the claim on the Business Customer. A **Customer Receipt** records money received and reduces Accounts Receivable. An issued invoice is not collected cash.

### 14. Stock Balance versus Stock Ledger

The **Stock Ledger** is the immutable, chronological history of every stock movement with quantity and value. The **Stock Balance** is the current position derived from that history. The balance is never adjusted directly; it changes only because a new ledger entry was created.

### 15. Posting versus Approval

**Approval** is a business authorisation by an accountable person. **Posting** is the committing of financial and inventory effects to the ledgers, after which the record is immutable. A document may be approved and not yet posted. Posting is not a second approval, and approval is not an accounting event.

### 16. Cancellation versus Reversal

**Cancellation** terminates a document that has **not** been posted; it has no ledger effect and the record and its number are retained. **Reversal** creates an equal and opposite posting to undo a document that **has** been posted; both the original and the reversal remain visible. Nothing is ever deleted, and posted documents are never edited.

### 17. Base Currency versus Transaction Currency

The **Base Currency** is the currency of the Company's books — SAR by default for Saudi tenants. The **Transaction Currency** is the currency of an individual document as agreed with the counterparty. Both amounts are retained; the transaction amount is never overwritten by conversion. The **Reporting Currency** is a third, presentation-only concept.

### 18. Permission versus Entitlement

A **Permission** is a user-level security right to perform an action. An **Entitlement** is a tenant-level commercial right to use a module or capacity, derived from the Subscription and Plan. Both must allow an action for it to succeed. Granting a permission for a module the tenant is not entitled to does not enable access, and being entitled to a module does not authorise any individual user.

### 19. Retail POS versus B2B Sales

**B2B Sales** is the Release 1 scope: named Business Customers, Quotation, Sales Order, Delivery, Sales Invoice, Customer Receipt, credit terms, and account trading. **Retail POS** is point-of-sale selling to walk-in consumers with cashier operations, cash drawers, retail shifts, and retail checkout.

- **Retail POS is not part of Release 1.**
- **Retail POS must not be used as a synonym for B2B Sales.** The two have different actors, controls, cash handling, and documents.
- **POS may be considered only as a future module** consuming the shared Sales, Inventory, Finance, Tax, and Payment capabilities, rather than duplicating them.

Any requirement that mentions a cashier, a cash drawer, a retail shift, or a retail checkout is out of Release 1 scope and must be recorded as future scope, never written into a Release 1 BRD.

# 12. Banned and deprecated vocabulary

To keep BRD language consistent, the following terms must not be used in any Release 1 BRD, business rule, or acceptance scenario.

| Do not use | Use instead | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Cashier, cash drawer, till, shift, checkout | No Release 1 equivalent | Retail POS concepts, excluded from Release 1 |
| POS sale, retail sale, walk-in customer | Sales Order, Delivery, Sales Invoice to a Business Customer | Release 1 is B2B only |
| GRN used to mean the invoice | Goods Receipt for the physical event; Purchase Invoice for the financial claim | The two events are distinct |
| Bill | Purchase Invoice or Sales Invoice, stated explicitly | Ambiguous direction |
| Stock card, stock file | Stock Ledger for history; Stock Balance for the current position | The two are different concepts |
| Client, account, buyer | Business Customer, or Tenant where the Platform's own customer is meant | Ambiguous between the tenant's customer and the Platform's customer |
| Vendor account, vendor login | Supplier; suppliers have no login | Suppliers are not system users |
| Delete, edit posted document | Reversal, return, credit note, debit note, or adjustment | Posted records are immutable |
| Approve to mean post | Approval for authorisation; Posting for the ledger effect | Distinct controls |
| Branch stock | Warehouse stock | Stock exists at Warehouse level |
| Wafra process, Wafra rule | The generic product requirement it validates | No Wafra-specific core logic is permitted |

# 13. Governance of this glossary

- This glossary is the mandatory vocabulary for MESP-27 … MESP-40 and for every future implementation Story.
- It does **not** answer any open decision. Every term that depends on one names the Jira decision Task and stops there.
- It introduces **no Wafra-specific vocabulary**. Wafra is referred to only as the first validation tenant.
- Changes follow the BRD governance and approval process defined in MESP-17. A term whose approval status changes must be versioned, with the change recorded in the Product Decision Register (MESP-22).
- When an open decision (MESP-41 … MESP-56) is answered, the affected term moves from *Requires Business Decision* to *Approved Product Baseline* and the Traceability Matrix (MESP-19) is updated.

**Approval required from:** Product Owner, Business Sponsor, and the Business Process Owner of each affected domain. Named owners are pending — see MESP-20.
