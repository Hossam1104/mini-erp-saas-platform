# Release 1 MESP-116 Approved Decision and Dependency Map

## Current checkpoint overlay - 30 August 2026

This overlay does not change the approved plan baseline. MESP-132 through
MESP-137 are complete at their accepted bounded scopes. MESP-137 is the latest
merged capability through PR #84 from accepted feature head
`9406e8c6408251323b96d4a0c25082142546b9ef` at merge commit
`6b3aeb63da15253dee5466f7be001773b80c28ad`. PR #85 carries the post-closure
documentation reconciliation to `main` at
`4d6e33189a3835d5d8d2a58736055a837a3f5bc9`. MESP-144 is the current
repository-health checkpoint and is In Progress for GPT-5.6 Sol acceptance.

Fast-track completion is `21/26 = 80.8%`; this is capability completion, not
production readiness. Overall production readiness remains approximately `47%`
and Procurement/P2P `41%`. MESP-138 through MESP-142 remain To Do/inactive.
MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open production gates.

## 1. Authority and boundary

Hossam approved A1-A16 and B1-B6 at the exact bounded positions in the
Consolidated Owner Decision Pack. Class B is the Release 1 product and
implementation contract, not production approval: Finance, Inventory,
Reporting, Migration, Security/Audit, SQL/provider, and other named specialist
validation remains mandatory before production acceptance, irreversible
accounting/valuation/posting, destructive migration, cutover, rollback
commitment, or production distribution.

C1-C9 remain open production/external/legal/provider/infrastructure gates.
MESP-39 remains future-release and unactivated. MESP-40 remains a required
Release 1 migration/onboarding task but is unactivated. MESP-133 through
MESP-137 are complete at their accepted scopes; MESP-138 through MESP-142
remain To Do/not activated. MESP-144 is the current health checkpoint and
remains In Progress pending Sol acceptance.

## 2. Cross-cutting gates used by every capability

| Gate | Required boundary | Evidence before capability completion |
|---|---|---|
| G-SEC | Tenant is derived server-side; client input cannot broaden Tenant/Company/Branch/Warehouse authority; permissions, SoD, concurrency, denial, and support-access rules are enforced. | Focused authorization/Tenant-isolation tests and failure evidence. |
| G-AUD | Material business effects, approvals, corrections/reversals, imports, exports, and privileged actions have immutable, path-aware audit evidence. | Affected audit tests and traceable business scenarios. |
| G-LOC | EN/AR labels, Arabic/English content, RTL/LTR layout, localized numbers/dates/currency, accessibility, loading/empty/error/denied/unknown states are included where relevant. | Focused Angular tests/build and bilingual/RTL journey evidence; ADR-011 remains authoritative. |
| G-DATA | Module-owned source of truth, database integrity, idempotency/concurrency, accounting/stock invariants, and safe correction/reversal are explicit. | Affected backend/module/database tests; SQL/provider evidence is reported honestly. |
| G-PROD | MESP-48, MESP-50, SQL/provider, credentials, infrastructure, deployment, privacy/legal, external/statutory, and volume gates are not guessed. | Production/irreversible claims wait for the named gate and specialist evidence. |

## 3. Capability dependency map

The map is the implementation ordering and Definition-of-Ready handoff. The
existing capability descriptions in the full-feature plan and Jira remain the
detailed scope source; this map records the cross-module prerequisites and
acceptance boundary needed to activate one capability at a time.

## 4. Historical MESP-117 fresh-session handoff

The following handoff is preserved as approved historical evidence from the
MESP-116 governance session. The current executable handoff is the MESP-132
acceptance overlay at the top of this document.

MESP-117 is the first capability handoff, not an activation performed by
MESP-116. The next fresh session must:

1. verify the Jira issue remains To Do/not activated and no other capability is
   active;
2. read docs/16, docs/17, docs/18, docs/19, docs/20, ADR-002, ADR-005,
   ADR-011, the existing Master Data/Business Parties contracts, and the
   current source/diff;
3. preserve the bounded Category/UOM/Product/Supplier/Customer decisions and
   consume only server-derived Tenant authority;
4. implement the complete shared Angular UX plus only the missing API,
   contract, persistence, or integration seams necessary for those existing
   slices; include EN/AR, RTL/LTR, accessibility, audit, concurrency,
   authorization, denial, and unknown/error states;
5. validate focused backend/frontend behavior, authorization/Tenant isolation,
   audit/concurrency, localization/accessibility, and the applicable release
   build before opening a focused PR; and
6. stop after the MESP-117 review/closure handoff and write the next exact task.

MESP-117 must not start Currency, Tax/VAT, Pricing, Procurement, Inventory,
Finance, Sales, Reporting, Migration, MESP-39, providers, credentials,
infrastructure, Retail POS, or Wafra-specific core behavior. One person, one
active capability, one focused branch/PR remains mandatory.

## 5. Governance completion and unchanged boundaries

MESP-116 is Done at its bounded governance/reconciliation scope. No source,
tests, persistence, schema, migrations, APIs, UI, providers, credentials,
infrastructure, production configuration, or production capability changed.
The production-capability percentages therefore remain unchanged. MESP-23
remains In Progress; MESP-39 is future-release and unexecuted; MESP-40 is
required but unactivated; internal Tax/VAT is Release 1 required/Not Started
without statutory scope; Retail POS and Wafra-specific core behavior remain
excluded.
