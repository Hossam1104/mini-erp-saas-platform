## MESP-92 In Progress — single-effect durable work and immutable payloads

MESP-92 is **In Progress** on branch
`fix/MESP-92-single-effect-immutable-payloads`, based on merged-main baseline
`32a91f27bc162685fc0db0f38b031d02ffbc99d2`. It corrects four MESP-91-review
findings: H-5 (mutable stored payload references), H-6 (duplicate protected
effect after a caught post-boundary interruption or uncertain completion),
M-2 (sequential tests presented as concurrency evidence) and L-1 (misleading
Relational store naming). It does not reopen or change the disposition of
MESP-91.

A focused ChatGPT security review of PR #22 raised four further findings,
now corrected on this branch: H92-01 (effect keys collided across handler and
outbox purposes — the key now carries an explicit purpose and, for outbox,
the immutable EventId, and one shared `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` is the
single application-level authoritative guard); H92-02 (a generic retry
returned after reservation could release a guard whose effect may already
have run — the protected callback now returns an explicit
`DurableWorkProtectedEffectResult` outcome: Applied, NotAppliedRetryable,
OutcomeUnknown or TerminalNotApplied); M92-01 (uncertain effects now enter
the dedicated, Tenant-scoped `DurableWorkLifecycle.OutcomeUnknown`
reconciliation state, excluded from normal polling and generic
redelivery/replay, readable only through the Tenant-scoped
`ReadUncertainEffectsAsync` port); and M92-02 (the production
`TamperForValidation()` payload-mutation hook is removed, checksum-corruption
testing moved to bounded test-project reflection, and custom codec
exceptions are always wrapped in the safe `DurableWorkPayloadException`).

A second focused ChatGPT security review of PR #22 raised five further
findings, now corrected on this branch: H92-03 (the production API still
permitted the store, the dispatcher and a second dispatcher to each receive
an independent effect executor — `DurableWorkLocalRuntime.Create(...)` is now
the single approved composition entry point, the guard/executor/store/
dispatcher constructors are all `internal`, and a syntax-tree architecture
test proves no other shipping construction site exists); H92-04
(`ReadUncertainEffectsAsync` filtered only by TenantId, so a same-Tenant
context could read a sibling Company's, Branch's or Warehouse's uncertain
effects — it now requires a server-issued
`VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization` that live-revalidates actor,
session, Membership-or-SupportGrant validity and a dedicated
`work.reconciliation.read` permission, reusing the identical
organization-scope containment logic as MESP-91 dispatch revalidation);
M92-03 (`DurableWorkUncertainEffectRecord` now carries the exact
`DurableWorkEffectKey`, verified `TenantWorkScope`, actual `OutcomeUnknownAt`
and a preserved safe reason, instead of reusing `NextAttemptAt` and a
hard-coded reason); M92-04 (every codec exception, including one raised as
`DurableWorkPayloadException` itself, is normalized to the registry's own
fixed safe message, and the exception's constructor is now `internal`); and
L92-01 (the `OutcomeUnknown`/`IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` documentation now
distinguishes a caught post-boundary exception, cancellation, provider
uncertainty or completion-recording failure from an actual process crash,
which is not represented as any recorded outcome). PR #22 remains open,
non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused ChatGPT re-review of these
corrections.

Required maturity boundary for this correction, corrected: immutable payload
snapshot and stable work/effect identities are guaranteed; one automatic
protected-effect execution is guaranteed only within the local, in-memory,
non-crash-durable Foundation seam. This adapter preserves a caught
post-boundary interruption — an exception or cancellation observed inside
the running process after the reservation boundary — as `OutcomeUnknown`,
never automatically repeated. An actual process crash loses this adapter's
in-memory guard and lifecycle state entirely; that state loss is **not**
represented as `OutcomeUnknown` or any other recorded outcome. Production
durable crash recovery and distributed exactly-once delivery remain deferred
to a future SQL/durable provider; no production SQL work store, broker or
production worker exists.

Validation on this branch after the second focused-review correction: Release
build **0 warnings/0 errors**; focused DurableWork suite **199/199** passed;
full backend regression **457/457** passed including **11/11** SQL Server
LocalDB probes with no `MiniErpFoundation_*` database remaining after
teardown; Angular unit tests **27/27** passed; Angular production build
succeeded; Playwright **4/4** passed; `npm audit --omit=dev
--audit-level=high` reported **0** vulnerabilities.

MESP-92 is not marked Done by this checkpoint update. PR #22 is opened
non-draft and held unmerged pending a further focused ChatGPT re-review.

### Opus 5 independent verification at head `271e9df` (6 August 2026)

An independent Opus 5 project-wide review inspected the current PR #22 head
rather than accepting the reported dispositions. It confirmed all ten findings
from both focused review rounds as **closed**:

| Finding | Independent verdict | Evidence at head `271e9df` |
|---|---|---|
| H92-03 one authoritative effect ledger | **Closed** | All four ledger constructors are `internal`; `DurableWorkLocalRuntime.Create` supplies the identical executor instance to store and dispatcher; a syntax-tree test scans the whole `backend/src` tree for any other `new` site |
| H92-04 reconciliation-read authorization | **Closed** | `AuthorizeReconciliationReadUnsafe` requires a live actor/session, an exact Membership **or** SupportGrant path with no cross-fallback, the dedicated `work.reconciliation.read` permission, and `IsCurrentScopeContainedUnsafe`, which itself re-checks the underlying scope grant |
| M92-03 uncertain-effect identity and scope | **Closed** | `DurableWorkUncertainEffectRecord` carries the full purpose-qualified `DurableWorkEffectKey` and the exact `TenantWorkScope` |
| M92-04 codec exception secret retention | **Closed** | `DurableWorkPayloadRegistry.Capture`/`Decode` catch every non-cancellation exception and rethrow a fixed registry-owned message with no `InnerException` |
| L92-01 crash-behavior comments | **Closed** | `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` and `DurableWorkLifecycle.OutcomeUnknown` now state that a real process crash loses the in-memory guard entirely and is not a recorded outcome |
| Frontend regression not rerun | **Closed** | Complete frontend regression rerun at this head: 27/27 unit, production build passed, 4/4 Playwright, 0 audit vulnerabilities |

Two new findings were recorded, both **Low and non-blocking**:

- **O92-01** — `InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard.RecordOutcomeUnknown` accepts a
  `safeReason` and discards it; the guard retains no reason for an uncertain
  effect, so reconciliation evidence depends entirely on the separately stored
  work-item/outbox reason.
- **O92-02** — `InMemoryDurableWorkStore.ReadUncertainEffectsAsync` still falls
  back to `message.NextAttemptAt` when `OutcomeUnknownAt` is null, while the
  adjacent comment states `NextAttemptAt` is never reused as the occurrence
  time. The fallback is currently unreachable, so this is a code/comment
  contradiction rather than a behavioral defect.

The review also confirmed an important maturity boundary that this checkpoint
must state plainly: `DurableWorkLocalRuntime`, `InMemoryDurableWorkStore`,
`DurableWorkDispatcher` and `TenantDurableWorkWorker` are **not referenced by
`MiniErp.Api`**. The durable-work seam is a contract plus a local adapter with
test coverage; it is **not composed into the running host** and is not a
production capability. Separately, `MiniErp.App` grants
`InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.Api")`, so the `internal` constructors alone do
not prevent a future host composition root from constructing an independent
ledger — the syntax-tree architecture test is what closes that path, and it
matches only direct `new` expressions.

Code verdict: **CHANGES REQUIRED BEFORE MERGE** — 0 Critical, 0 High,
0 Medium, 2 Low. PR #22 remains open, unmerged and **not approved**; the merge
hold is the standing MESP-92 process gate awaiting focused ChatGPT re-review.

### O92-01/O92-02 closure overlay — 7 August 2026 (current, not a rewrite of the checkpoint above)

The checkpoint text above reflects head `271e9df` exactly as the Opus 5
project-wide review found it and is preserved unchanged. A bounded correction
on the same branch, at head `9dc6cb82860b10215d05364f2f6e25f69df3b986`, closes
both findings the review recorded: the guard now persists and exposes the
uncertain-effect safe reason it previously discarded (O92-01), and the
uncertain-effect read port now fails closed on a missing `OutcomeUnknownAt`
instead of substituting `NextAttemptAt` (O92-02). See
[`docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`](94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md#mesp-92-o92-01o92-02-focused-correction--in-progress)
and
[`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`](96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md#o92-01o92-02-focused-correction--7-august-2026)
for the full correction record and re-run validation totals
(216/216 focused, 474/474 full backend, 11/11 SQL LocalDB, 27/27 Angular,
Playwright 4/4, 0 audit vulnerabilities). No known MESP-92 code finding
remains open. PR #22 remains open, non-draft and unmerged pending a focused
ChatGPT security re-review at this head; MESP-92 is not marked Done.

### H92-05/M92-05 closure overlay — 7 August 2026 (current, not a rewrite of the checkpoint above)

The overlay above reflects head `9dc6cb8` exactly as recorded and is
preserved unchanged. A further focused ChatGPT security re-review of PR #22
at that head raised two new findings, both closed by a bounded correction on
the same branch at head `576996f94ae9ddc251767445a7ebddd60c492c45`:

- **H92-05 (High) — closed.** `DurableWorkLocalRuntime` publicly exposed
  `EffectGuard`/`EffectExecutor`, letting a shipping caller reserve, release,
  complete or mark an effect uncertain outside the approved executor (for
  example releasing an in-flight reservation so a second dispatch executes
  the same protected effect twice). `DurableWorkLocalRuntime`'s public
  surface is now limited to `Store`/`Dispatcher`; the guard, the executor and
  their state/reservation/execution-result types are internal to
  `MiniErp.App`.
- **M92-05 (Medium) — closed.** `IDurableWorkEffectGuard.GetOutcomeUnknownReason`
  was reachable from a raw `DurableWorkEffectKey` alone, bypassing the H92-04
  authorized reconciliation port. The interface is now internal, so the
  method is not reachable from any public type; it remains an
  internal/test-only seam over the O92-01 preserved reason. The only publicly
  reachable uncertain-effect evidence path remains
  `ReadUncertainEffectsAsync(VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization)`.

**Public-surface evidence:** `DurableWorkLocalRuntime` exposes exactly `Store`
and `Dispatcher` publicly; `IDurableWorkEffectGuard`,
`InMemoryDurableWorkEffectGuard`, `IDurableWorkEffectExecutor` and
`DurableWorkEffectExecutor` are non-public types; no public method in
`MiniErp.App` returns, accepts or is typed as any of the four, and no public
method accepts only a raw `DurableWorkEffectKey` and returns reason/state
evidence — all verified by reflection in the new
`DurableWorkEffectLedgerSurfaceTests.cs` (14 tests), including an executable
attack-regression proving a blocked in-flight reservation cannot be released
through any publicly reachable member and the effect still executes exactly
once. See
[`docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`](94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md#mesp-92-h92-05m92-05-focused-correction--in-progress)
and
[`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`](96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md#h92-05m92-05-focused-correction--7-august-2026)
for the full correction record and re-run validation totals (230/230
focused, 488/488 full backend, 11/11 SQL LocalDB, 27/27 Angular, Playwright
4/4, 0 audit vulnerabilities). O92-01 and O92-02 remain closed. No known
MESP-92 code finding remains open at this head. PR #22 remains open,
non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused ChatGPT security re-review;
MESP-92 is not marked Done.

### H92-06/M92-07/L92-02 closure overlay — 7 August 2026 (current, not a rewrite of the checkpoint above)

The overlay above reflects head `576996f` exactly as recorded and is
preserved unchanged. **One statement in the original checkpoint body needs an
explicit correction, not just a later overlay:** the paragraph above (under
"The review also confirmed an important maturity boundary...") states that
`MiniErp.App` grants `InternalsVisibleTo("MiniErp.Api")` and that "the
`internal` constructors alone do not prevent a future host composition root
from constructing an independent ledger — the syntax-tree architecture test is
what closes that path." That was true as written for the H92-03 construction
site alone, but it understated the consequence: the same friend-assembly grant
also let the shipping `MiniErp.Api` host reach `EffectGuard`/`EffectExecutor`
and call `TryReserve`/`Release`/`RecordCompleted`/`RecordOutcomeUnknown`/
`GetOutcomeUnknownReason` directly, regardless of any `internal` modifier,
because a friend assembly sees another assembly's internals exactly as if
they were public. This was H92-06 (High) and, for the raw-key reason bypass
specifically, M92-07 (Medium). Both are closed by a bounded correction on the
same branch at head `e991641`:

- **H92-06 (High) — closed.** `backend/src/MiniErp.App/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`
  now grants `InternalsVisibleTo` only to `MiniErp.ArchitectureTests`; the
  grant to `MiniErp.Api` is removed. The one resulting `MiniErp.Api` compile
  break (`FoundationHostSignInResult.Principal`, needed for
  `HttpContext.SignInAsync`) was unrelated to durable work and is resolved by
  a narrow public property, not by restoring friend access. No mutable ledger
  type is public.
- **M92-07 (Medium) — closed.** `GetOutcomeUnknownReason` is declared only on
  the already-internal `IDurableWorkEffectGuard`, so removing the friend grant
  removes `MiniErp.Api`'s only path to it. The only publicly reachable
  uncertain-effect evidence path remains
  `ReadUncertainEffectsAsync(VerifiedDurableWorkReconciliationAuthorization)`,
  unchanged.
- **L92-02 (Low, scope cleanup) — closed.** `frontend/angular.json` is
  restored to the exact `origin/main` analytics state, removing an unrelated
  identifier an earlier commit had added.

**Friend-assembly evidence:** new `FriendAssemblyPolicyTests.cs` (5 tests)
proves by reflection that `MiniErp.App`'s `InternalsVisibleTo` allow-list is
exactly `["MiniErp.ArchitectureTests"]`, and by full Roslyn compilation that
source compiled under the assembly name `MiniErp.Api` cannot compile
(`CS0122`) against the internal ledger guard/executor or their
construct/reserve/release/record/read-reason members, while identical source
compiled under `MiniErp.ArchitectureTests` still succeeds — verified to fail
against the prior vulnerable state before being verified to pass against this
correction. See
[`docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`](94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md#mesp-92-h92-06m92-07l92-02-focused-correction--in-progress)
and
[`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`](96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md#h92-06m92-07l92-02-focused-correction--7-august-2026)
for the full correction record and re-run validation totals (238/238
focused, 493/493 full backend, 11/11 SQL LocalDB, 27/27 Angular, Playwright
4/4, 0 audit vulnerabilities). O92-01, O92-02, H92-05 and M92-05 remain
closed. No known MESP-92 code finding remains open at this head. PR #22
remains open, non-draft and unmerged pending a further focused ChatGPT
security re-review; MESP-92 is not marked Done.

## MESP-91 correction overlay — merged and Done

The MESP-64 merged-main checkpoint above is the prior historical Foundation
baseline; this overlay is Correction Package 1, approved by focused ChatGPT
security review and merged to `main` through PR #20 at commit
`f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`. MESP-91 is Done; no implementation
item is currently active. It adds an Identity-owned verified organization-scope
resolver, exact Tenant -> Company -> Branch -> Warehouse ownership and
downward containment, authorization-context binding for issued scopes, and
live worker/outbox authority revalidation immediately before handler/effect
dispatch. Failed current User/session, Membership or SupportGrant/SupportCase,
Permission, scope or ownership checks terminally dead-letter with safe
`AuthorizationDenied` evidence. MESP-31 and packages 2/3 (MESP-92, MESP-93
and MESP-94)
remain To Do and untouched; no Sprint, migration, production provider or
business-domain implementation is authorized.

Current correction validation is 102/102 focused durable-work tests, 360/360
backend tests including 11/11 disposable LocalDB SQL tests, 27/27 Angular
tests and four Playwright journeys. The Release build has zero warnings and
zero errors; the production dependency audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
H91-03 now requires canonical explicit ordinary scope and keeps the stored
case-bound SupportGrant scope authoritative; H91-04 applies one exact binding
to work, Tenant, operation, correlation, organization scope, execution
context, path, Membership/SupportGrant, actor and session.

## Verified baseline

The Foundation implementation sequence is merged to `main` and Jira is
reconciled. The repository was clean after merged-main validation, and local
`main` matched `origin/main` at `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`
after the MESP-91 correction merge. The MESP-91 correction branch received
focused ChatGPT security review, was merged through PR #20, and its source and
tests are now represented as merged-main capability.

LocalDB is a disposable test provider. It is not a production provider
selection, production sizing result, migration, backup/restore proof or
deployment approval.

### Validation totals

The MESP-64 evidence is recorded in
[`docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md`](96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md).
It records the exact 75 assertions from LIS v0.4 section 48 and does not
convert a deferred or not-applicable requirement into a production claim.

## Plan traceability

The Foundation chain is controlled as follows:

| Layer | Approved or implemented evidence |
|---|---|
| PRD | PRD v1.2 establishes the Release 1 B2B ERP boundary, platform hierarchy and modular-monolith direction; Retail POS is excluded. |
| BRDs | MESP-27 Platform Administration, MESP-28 Identity and Access v0.3, MESP-29 Multi-Tenancy v0.2 and MESP-30 Organization v0.2 are the approved business baselines. Later ERP BRDs remain incomplete. |
| LIS | `docs/15_Foundation_Release_1_Lean_Implementation_Specification.md` v0.4 defines the approved Foundation contracts, journeys, integrity rules, operation catalogue and exact 75-assertion safety catalogue. |
| ADRs | ADR-001 through ADR-018 establish bounded architecture, identity, persistence, REST, audit, worker, private-file and testing decisions; production/provider ADRs remain gated where stated. |
| Jira | MESP-57, MESP-58, MESP-87, MESP-59, MESP-88, MESP-60, MESP-62, MESP-89, MESP-63, MESP-90, MESP-61 and MESP-64 are Done with sequential evidence. MESP-48/MESP-50 remain To Do gates. |
| Code | `backend/` contains the modular seam, trusted Tenant persistence, identity/session/authorization, REST contracts, audit hooks, host integration and bounded durable-work/file contracts; `frontend/` contains the Angular shell and safe session/context/RTL behavior. |
| Tests | xUnit architecture, persistence, identity, REST, audit, durable-work and host tests; SQL Server LocalDB provider probes; Angular tests; Playwright TypeScript journeys; build, diff and dependency-audit gates. |
| Pull Requests | PRs #1, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #14, #16, #17 and #18 are merged to `main` in sequence. |
| Evidence | `docs/95_Foundation_Backend_Review_Checkpoint.md` preserves the earlier backend checkpoint; `docs/96_Foundation_Release1_Safety_Validation.md` records the final SQL Server/75-assertion evidence; this document records the complete sequence and its maturity boundary. |

No layer authorizes production deployment or later ERP transaction work by
itself. The authority remains the approved business baseline plus the owning
Jira and production gates.

## Foundation capability status

| Capability | Completion status and bounded evidence |
|---|---|
| Modular architecture | Implemented modular-monolith solution seam with API → App → Contracts direction and Platform Administration boundary; no microservices or Kubernetes. |
| Tenant isolation | Trusted server-derived Tenant context, query filters, stored-owner checks, relationship guards, Tenant-aware keys and cross-Tenant denial tests. |
| Identity and session | In-memory Foundation Identity/session seam, secure HTTP-only cookie/antiforgery host integration, revocation and expiry contracts; production Identity provider remains deferred. |
| Authorization | Policy/resource authorization, exact operation catalogue, OrdinaryMembership/SupportGrant separation, Platform governance boundary and mandatory protected-write evidence. |
| REST/OpenAPI | Versioned `/api/v1` operation catalogue, safe Problem Details errors, correlation, concurrency and idempotency contracts; no business transaction API. |
| Safe errors | Denials avoid foreign target identifiers, provider details, stack traces, secrets and business payloads. |
| Correlation | Correlation and operation identifiers flow through REST, audit and bounded durable-work contracts without exposing payloads. |
| Concurrency | Local optimistic concurrency and bounded claim/lease contracts; SQL Server `rowversion` and stale update/delete behavior validated on disposable LocalDB. |
| Idempotency | Composite authorized-binding/idempotency behavior and test-only `(TenantId, EventId)` uniqueness prove Tenant-scoped duplicate handling; durable production storage remains deferred. |
| Audit/observability | Immutable path-aware local evidence, append-before-effect coordination and OpenTelemetry-compatible hooks; no exporter or operational retention decision. |
| Angular shell | Angular 22 standalone modular shell with server-confirmed session/context handling, safe anonymous/expired/revoked states and accessible responsive layout. |
| Bilingual RTL | EN/AR resources and runtime LTR/RTL switching are implemented in the Wave 1 shell; localized business documents/search remain future module scope. |
| Sign-out correction | MESP-90 preserves authenticated state until server-confirmed 204 or 401; failed/unconfirmed revocation does not falsely clear the browser session. |
| Durable work | Typed Tenant-bound work/outbox/inbox contracts, verified organization-scope resolver, live worker/outbox authority revalidation, bounded lease/retry/dead-letter and optimistic version controls; no broker or production worker deployment. |
| Notifications | Provider-neutral Tenant-owned notification intents and deterministic local adapter; no email/SMS/push vendor or delivery policy selected. |
| Private files | Tenant-owned metadata, opaque object identity, checksum and safe authorization/local adapter boundary; no public URL, signed download, provider, scanning or purge. |
| SQL Server validation | SQL Server LocalDB provider-specific schema/index/rowversion/collation, transaction, relationship, idempotency and lease probes passed; LocalDB is disposable and not production-equivalent. |
| Safety harness | One-command fail-closed LocalDB script, deterministic teardown and exact 75-assertion report; MESP-48/MESP-50 production decisions remain explicit. |

## Exact maturity boundaries

| Boundary | What is true | What is not claimed |
|---|---|---|
| Implemented contract | Foundation interfaces, domain guards, safe errors, operation catalogue, Angular shell and bounded local adapters are implemented and tested. | Complete ERP business behavior, all BRDs or production operations. |
| Local provider | In-memory identity/session, local audit/idempotency, notification and private-file adapters support repeatable development tests. | Durable production persistence, external identity, provider SLA or production data handling. |
| Disposable test provider | SQL Server LocalDB validates provider-specific behavior in an isolated disposable database per run. | Production SQL topology, sizing, HA, backup/restore, residency, network isolation or vendor approval. |
| Production provider | None selected for Identity, audit export, notification, object storage, SQL deployment or assurance services. | Production secrets, regions, retention, scanning, signed URLs or external integrations. |
| Production migration | No migration was generated, applied or committed. | Physical production schema, migration rollout or database-per-Tenant shape. |
| Production readiness | Not approved. MESP-48, MESP-50 and the remaining production ADRs are still required. | Go-live, UAT completion, capacity claim, purge/retention execution or operational sign-off. |

## Remaining gates

- **MESP-48** remains the supported-volume, throughput, queue-depth, lease,
  recovery and capacity gate. No volume limit or performance claim was
  invented by the Foundation implementation.
- **MESP-50** remains the provider/vendor, residency, retention, privacy,
  legal-hold, purge, backup and restoration gate. No physical purge or
  retention execution occurred.
- Required production ADR decisions remain open where their timing says so,
  including ADR-002, ADR-010, ADR-011, ADR-012, ADR-013, ADR-014, ADR-015,
  ADR-016 and ADR-017 as applicable to the owning module or release decision.
- Production Identity/session, MFA/fresh-auth and assurance providers remain
  unselected; local contracts do not authorize production credentials.
- Durable audit/exporter, telemetry access/retention, production object
  storage, malware scanning, deployment topology and operations remain open.
- Complete ERP domains and their BRDs remain incomplete. MESP-31 through
  MESP-40 are To Do; Master Data and Catalog must not start before Opus 5
  review authorizes the next requirements step.

## Opus 5 review questions

Opus 5 should determine:

1. Does the complete Foundation sequence match the approved PRD, BRDs, LIS and
   delivery plan without silently expanding Release 1 scope?
2. Does Tenant isolation remain safe across API, persistence, worker, audit,
   notification and private-file paths, including forged and concurrent cases?
3. Are Identity/session, authorization, context selection and Angular behavior
   coherent, including the MESP-90 false-logout correction?
4. Is durable work genuinely single-effect, Tenant-bound, organization-
   ownership-verified, revalidated against current User/session/permission and
   Membership or SupportGrant authority immediately before handler/effect
   dispatch, and safely retried/dead-lettered?
5. Are private-file metadata, checksum, ownership and access boundaries safe
   without public access or purge behavior?
6. Is the SQL Server LocalDB evidence trustworthy for the claims it makes, and
   are its provider limitations accurately stated?
7. Are all 75 mandatory Foundation assertions traceable to executable evidence
   or an approved scoped deferral with an owner and gate?
8. Does the documentation accurately distinguish local, disposable-provider
   and production maturity?
9. Is any Critical or High correction required before further Foundation or
   domain work?
10. May Master Data and Product Catalog requirements/design work begin, or must
    another approved correction be completed first?

## Completion state and stop rule

At this checkpoint:

- MESP-90, MESP-61, MESP-64 and MESP-91 are Done and merged.
- No implementation item is currently active, and no Sprint is active.
  MESP-92 is the next eligible correction.
- The historical Foundation implementation checkpoint is reconciled with the
  merged MESP-91 correction overlay; focused ChatGPT security review approved
  PR #20 (APPROVED TO MERGE; 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium blockers) before merge.
- Product-wide core ERP BRDs remain incomplete; complete ERP backend
  implementation is not complete.
- MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain production gates.
- Master Data and Catalog must not start until Opus 5 review authorizes it.
- No MESP-31 or later domain, MESP-48/MESP-50 implementation, package 2/3,
  Sprint,
  production deployment, migration or business transaction work is started by
  this documentation checkpoint.

**Final state:** MESP-90, MESP-61, MESP-64 and MESP-91 remain merged and Done
on the Foundation baseline. MESP-91 Correction Package 1 was approved by
focused ChatGPT security review and merged through PR #20 at
`f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`. MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain
production gates; no core ERP BRD, MESP-31, package 2/3 or production
implementation was started. MESP-92 is the next eligible correction and had
not started before MESP-91 closure.

## MESP-91 correction overlay disposition — merged and Done

The historical checkpoint above is now reconciled with the merged MESP-91
overlay. The correction is implemented through commit
`4ed4b0588b613d492ce6c446ae963001b28f0eca` (approved PR #20 head
`92bd9fd38912a062cc3723f46867258d54ca8127`) on the merged branch, integrated
to `main` at `f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`. The
correction closes the focused authorization findings by:

- binding durable operations to one authoritative descriptor containing the
  exact permission code, authorization paths and scope policy;
- returning a server-issued exact-scope execution authorization from live
  revalidation and requiring both worker and outbox effects to consume it;
- separating true `AuthorizationDenied` from recoverable
  `ProviderUnavailable` and `Cancelled` outcomes, with bounded retry and safe
  lease/outbox recovery; and
- removing the unrestricted shipping `ForServerContext` scope factory while
  retaining a test-only fixture issuer through the architecture-test assembly.

The correction validation record is **360/360** complete backend tests,
**11/11** SQL Server LocalDB probes, **27/27** Angular tests, **4/4** Playwright
journeys, Release build 0 warnings/0 errors, and production dependency audit 0
vulnerabilities. The disposable LocalDB/model collation was
`SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`, and teardown left no `MiniErpFoundation_*`
database.

Source/test correction commit `4ed4b0588b613d492ce6c446ae963001b28f0eca`
was on the dedicated branch against baseline
`4eb1ef3ab094242cbb26ec9ab79b4037512e0d2d`, with approved head
`92bd9fd38912a062cc3723f46867258d54ca8127`. Focused ChatGPT security review
approved PR #20 to merge; it merged by normal merge commit at
`f2cde57400fed470ab048776e05b56f353b36890`. MESP-91 is **Done**; MESP-92 is
the next eligible correction; MESP-93, MESP-94 and
MESP-31 remain **To Do**. No Sprint, Master Data implementation, production
provider, migration, MESP-48 or MESP-50 work was started.

## Foundation correction checkpoint — MESP-92/93/94 closed (8 August 2026)

Everything above this section is the preserved historical Foundation
checkpoint as reviewed on 6 August 2026, when MESP-92 was still In Progress
on open PR #22. It is not rewritten. Since that checkpoint: MESP-92 closed
(PR #22 merged to `main` at `322341e70e56270797d5770b4b90342c20b7833e`,
focused ChatGPT security review verdict APPROVED FOR MERGE); MESP-93 closed
(PR #24 merged to `main` at `005c796629341ab9becfbc6d1abe2ae34b6a7332`,
focused ChatGPT security re-review verdict APPROVED FOR MERGE); and MESP-94
closed (PR #26 merged to `main` at actual merge commit
`06d837c958c1cb7977dc121e3aaea4e7278944fd`, approved final head
`2c7ed3dec4662672bb78967ceb70db7ed73eb7d4`, ChatGPT final merge review
verdict APPROVED FOR MERGE). All three corrections are **Done**.

This is a bounded checkpoint, not a redesign — it answers Opus 5 review
question 10 above ("May Master Data and Product Catalog requirements/design
work begin, or must another approved correction be completed first?") for
the current state:

- No further Foundation correction ticket is outstanding; MESP-92, MESP-93
  and MESP-94 are all Done.
- MESP-48 (supported-volume/performance) and MESP-50 (retention, privacy,
  legal-hold, purge, residency, backup/restoration) remain intentionally
  open, explicit **production** gates. Neither is, or should be treated as,
  a blocker to drafting the MESP-31 BRD — they gate production
  implementation and go-live, not requirements/design work.
- No remaining Foundation correction ticket blocks **BRD entry**. Foundation
  completion is therefore a necessary condition for MESP-31 BRD entry, and
  it is now satisfied.
- Foundation completion is **not by itself a sufficient condition**.
  `docs/94_Product_Delivery_Master_Plan.md`'s "Next authorized sequence"
  requires MESP-31's BRD entry conditions to be independently "reconfirmed"
  before starting (step 9), and the only recorded precedent for that
  reconfirmation — MESP-29's, in `docs/13_Multi_Tenancy_BRD.md` SC-001 — was
  a distinct, explicit founder/owner authorization statement, not an
  automatic consequence of Foundation completion. No equivalent
  authorization is recorded for MESP-31, whose Jira Task still carries the
  standing instruction not to move to In Progress until its BRD entry
  criteria are approved.

**Conclusion:** `MESP-31 BRD ENTRY: NOT YET ELIGIBLE FOR AUTOMATIC START —
OWNER APPROVAL REQUIRED.` MESP-31 remains **To Do**. This checkpoint does not
move MESP-31 to In Progress and does not start Master Data implementation,
which in any case remains blocked until both the MESP-31 BRD and its
separate implementation gate are approved (step 10 of the master plan's
authorized sequence). See `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` for the current canonical
state.

## Superseded — MESP-31 BRD entry authorized (8 August 2026)

Everything above this section is the preserved historical checkpoint record.
Two of its statements are no longer the current state and are corrected here:

1. The banner near the top of this document says **MESP-94 is "In Progress"**
   on branch `fix/MESP-94-foundation-validation-evidence`. **MESP-94 is
   Done.** PR #26 merged to `main` at
   `06d837c958c1cb7977dc121e3aaea4e7278944fd` after a ChatGPT final merge
   review verdict of APPROVED FOR MERGE at approved head
   `2c7ed3dec4662672bb78967ceb70db7ed73eb7d4`; PR #27 then merged its
   post-merge closure at `c86ecb851e88205f1d3907f5a5c36cfb59ce8b54`, the
   current merged-main baseline. The header table's "Active implementation
   item" row, which names MESP-92 as In Progress, is likewise the 6 August
   position and not current — **no implementation item is active.**
2. The conclusion above, `MESP-31 BRD ENTRY: NOT YET ELIGIBLE FOR AUTOMATIC
   START — OWNER APPROVAL REQUIRED`, was correct when written and is now
   **satisfied**. Hossam recorded the required distinct BRD-entry owner
   authorization on 8 August 2026 (live Jira comment `10615` on MESP-31),
   explicitly scoping MESP-31 to Products, Product Categories, Units of
   Measure, Suppliers, Business Customers, Price Lists, Taxes, Payment
   Terms, Currencies and Exchange Rates, and separately pre-authorized the
   later Master Data implementation phase (comment `10616`, conditional).
   **MESP-31 is In Progress**, under Parent Epic `MESP-6 — EPIC 06 - Master
   Data and Product Catalog`, on branch
   `docs/MESP-31-master-data-product-catalog-brd`, with a v0.2 draft BRD at
   `docs/16_Master_Data_and_Product_Catalog_BRD.md` published on open
   **PR #28** and pending Hossam's business-owner review.

What has **not** changed: the BRD is **Draft, not Approved**; step 10 of the
master plan's authorized sequence continues to apply in full; and **no
Master Data implementation has started or may start** until Hossam approves
the BRD as a business baseline and a dedicated implementation Jira item,
separate from MESP-31, is identified and activated. MESP-48 and MESP-50
remain intentionally open production gates. `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` is the
canonical live-state document.
