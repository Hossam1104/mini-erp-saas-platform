# Pre-MESP-38 Independent Review Reconciliation

## Reconciliation record

| Field | Reconciled position |
| --- | --- |
| Independent checkpoint | Opus 5 pre-MESP-38 review |
| Reviewed baseline | `main` at `fc46fc9`, the synchronized MESP-37 closure and MESP-38 handoff baseline |
| Original verdict | `HOLD — CORRECTION REQUIRED BEFORE MESP-38` |
| Findings | 0 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium, 2 Low (`O5-PRE38-001` through `O5-PRE38-006`) |
| Reconciliation task | MESP-114, completed only after the corrections below were validated |
| Durable Inventory owner | MESP-113 under MESP-8, still `To Do` and unapproved |
| Scope result | Governance, state, handoff, Jira, and one Inventory cross-reference only; no production capability changed |

## Finding dispositions

| Finding | Disposition and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| O5-PRE38-001 — stale governance overlays (High) | Accepted and corrected. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` now identify the 12 August 2026 reconciliation position as current and label the older overlays historical. `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` has a current authoritative section at the top, and `TASK.md` is the exact next MESP-38 handoff. |
| O5-PRE38-002 — ownership and dependency reading (High) | Accepted and corrected. `TASK.md` explicitly requires MESP-28 IAM, MESP-29 Multi-Tenancy, and MESP-30 Organization and binding consumption of their ownership. The handoff states that MESP-38 must consume, not redefine, identity, tenant isolation/context, Company/Branch/Warehouse hierarchy, and scope boundaries. |
| O5-PRE38-003 — incomplete ADR/security reading (Medium) | Accepted and corrected. `TASK.md` names ADR-002, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 013, 014, 016, and 018 plus the architecture security sections for tenant/request-context isolation, authentication/authorization, files/private downloads, and audit/observability. Incomplete ADR/index entries remain gates; ADR-011 is recorded as the localization dependency, not the primary security owner. |
| O5-PRE38-004 — MESP-53 metadata (Low) | Accepted and corrected. The current state and handoff describe MESP-53 as report catalogue and reconciliation ownership. It is not a security decision and does not block defining security/audit requirements. Jira status remains `To Do`. |
| O5-PRE38-005 — INV-OD-004 durable owner (Medium) | Accepted and corrected without deciding the business policy. MESP-113 was created under MESP-8, remains `To Do` and unapproved, and is linked to MESP-23. Inventory BRD row INV-OD-004 points to MESP-113; comment 10894 records the MESP-23 register cross-reference. |
| O5-PRE38-006 — stale `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` entry (Low) | Accepted and corrected. The 8 August position is explicitly historical and its “new agent” instruction is requalified as preserved evidence. The current authoritative position and root handoff are now the entry points. |

## Preserved gates and handoff

The reconciliation does not approve any open business decision or alter the
Release 1 B2B ERP boundary. MESP-23 remains In Progress; MESP-38 remains
`To Do` and was not executed; and MESP-48, MESP-50, MESP-53, MESP-54, and
MESP-110 remain open. MESP-54 still owns unresolved exchange-rate sourcing
and update policy, and MESP-110 still owns unresolved Finance year-end,
Payment Term, and posting-dimension detail. MESP-113 does not resolve
INV-OD-004. The reconciliation preserves the production gates for supported
volume, retention/residency/privacy/legal hold/export/purge, secrets and
keys, telemetry, RLS, provider/production readiness, and external validation.
It also preserves the Saudi-localized B2B boundary and excludes Retail POS,
Wafra-specific core behavior, Currency implementation, tax/ZATCA delivery,
and statutory or legal certification.

## Final reconciliation verdict

`PASS — READY FOR THE FUTURE MESP-38 DOCUMENTATION-ONLY ENTRY`

This verdict means only that the six independent-review corrections are
recorded and the next-session handoff is ready. It does not activate MESP-38,
approve its BRD, resolve the decision register, or authorize source or
production work.
