# MESP-135 closed - GPT-5.6 Sol next-capability selection handoff

This is the complete current post-closure repository handoff. MESP-135 is
**Done** in Jira and its accounting acceptance is final. PR #79 is
**MERGED/CLOSED** and non-Draft at the verified squash merge on `main`:

- Accepted feature head: `dbc239d6bd1ef948bb8505d4360208f4a3470dda`
- Squash merge: `8238ce562ee165def8ecdbfa07b285aeb3f1a2ef`
- Jira closure comment: `12200`
- MESP-10 reconciliation comment: `12201`

The post-merge integration gate recovered from an operational repository-owned
backend DLL lock. After the lock was safely released, the bounded Release
retry passed with **0 warnings / 0 errors**; no source or accounting correction
was made and MESP-135 acceptance was not reopened. The validated runtime was
left running with backend port `5300` PID `45016` and frontend port `4300` PID
`19140`. All 11 required probes returned HTTP 200:
`/health`, `/openapi/v1.json`, `/`, `/main.js`, `/app/finance`,
`/app/finance/ap`, `/app/finance/ar`, `/app/finance/settlements`,
`/app/finance/tax-fx`, `/app/finance/close`, and `/app/finance/reports`.

The authoritative fast-track capability completion is **19/26 = 73.1%**.
Production readiness remains separate from fast-track completion; the last
accepted estimate remains approximately **47% overall** and **41%
Procurement/P2P**, with no percentage increase inferred from this
documentation reconciliation. MESP-10 remains **In Progress**. MESP-48 and
MESP-50 remain open production gates. MESP-139 remains **inactive**.

There is **NO active implementation capability** at this moment. The next
action belongs to GPT-5.6 Sol: inspect the live Jira dependency graph,
reconcile remaining MESP-10 Finance work and cross-Epic prerequisites, and
choose/explicitly activate exactly one eligible next capability. No executor
may infer that MESP-139 or any other ticket is next, and no Jira writes were
performed by Luna in this reconciliation.

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT A NEXT CAPABILITY FROM THIS TASK.md UNTIL GPT-5.6 SOL HAS
COMPLETED DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS AND WRITTEN A NEW ACTIVATION HANDOFF.**

## Historical MESP-135 Sol HOLD 6 final bounded remediation and handoff

This bounded session completed only the already-authorized MESP-135 Sol HOLD 6
remediation on the existing Draft PR #79 / branch
`feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`. Mandatory preflight was exact: starting
feature and remote feature `243199b22b1762f0797d19702577b874429dabaf`, live
`origin/main` `0d1485d4a2197f23250b1d5acc1a00ddf26dc4c9`, legitimate merge-base
`841a777af1622cb4de9c3708cd4a2b389b7ef9e9`, and the only main-only drift was
the expected presentation PPTX. The presentation remains main-only and was
not copied, edited, restored, or committed on this feature branch.

HOLD 6 makes Close readiness consume effective MESP-134 unrealized-FX
reconciliation records rather than treating persisted period-end lines as
active merely because they exist. A valid reversed line remains historical
evidence but is inactive for current coverage; the replacement line must be the
sole active reconciled candidate. Zero-effect sources tolerate valid reversed
historical evidence but reject unexpected active evidence. Missing, broken,
duplicate, stale, extra, invalid, cross-Company, and cross-Tenant evidence
fails closed. Deterministic coverage fingerprinting includes the authoritative
scope, effective active candidates, and unresolved evidence, while preserving
the later-reversal historical snapshot behavior. No public endpoint, entity,
DbContext, configuration, schema, migration, or `frontend/assets` file changed.

The focused implementation/test commit is
`69b20b3c0dbba2a7f3b6c5ade2a19f63ad7fb9bb`. Validation is Release
`0 warnings/0 errors`; focused MESP-133 `22/22`, MESP-134 `27/27`, and
MESP-135 `31/31`; full disposable-LocalDB backend `1,098/1,098`; complete SQL
safety `80/80`; focused HOLD6/MESP-134 SQL contention `14/14`; REST/OpenAPI/
host `55/55`; catalogue `383` public and `2` internal; EF reports no pending
model changes; Angular `296/296` across 41 specs; focused/full Chromium
`15/15` and `47/47`; both npm audits report 0 vulnerabilities; and the NuGet
vulnerable-package scan is clear. MESP-135 remains In Progress, MESP-139
remains inactive, fast-track remains `18/26 = 69.2%`, and production
readiness remains approximately `47%` overall / `41%` Procurement/P2P.

The official runtime was restarted through
`scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` with the explicit loopback
Development bypass: API PID `38772` on `http://localhost:5300` and Angular PID
`8036` on `http://localhost:4300`. All 11 required probes returned HTTP 200;
both repository-owned processes remain running. No Jira write, Opus review,
Ready transition, merge, rebase, force-push, or second PR occurred. Stop for
GPT-5.6 Sol HOLD 6 acceptance.

# Historical MESP-135 - Sol HOLD 4 final bounded remediation - final handoff for Sol re-review

This bounded remediation closes the single remaining GPT-5.6 Sol HOLD 4
blocker on the existing Draft PR #79 / branch
`feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`. Sol independently accepted every HOLD 3
fix except the historical-as-of defect in the period-end revaluation readiness
gate. This session does not redesign MESP-135, modify unrelated Finance
behavior, write Jira, invoke Claude Opus, mark the PR Ready, merge, rebase,
force-push, create a second PR, or activate MESP-139 or any other capability.
STOP after this handoff for independent Sol HOLD 4 re-review.

Jira governance references: MESP-135 activation `12123`, HOLD 1 `12130`,
HOLD 1 supplemental `12132`, HOLD 2 `12135`, HOLD 3 `12140`, HOLD 4 `12174`,
and MESP-10 HOLD 4 reconciliation `12175`. No Jira write was performed.

## HOLD 4 closure

**The defect.** `FinanceMesp135Persistence.EvaluateReadinessAsync` decided the
`revaluation_policy` check with a current-lifecycle query:

```csharp
db.RevaluationBatches.AnyAsync(item =>
    item.CompanyId == companyId &&
    item.AsOfDate == period.EndDate &&
    item.Status == FinanceRevaluationBatchStatus.Posted)
```

`FinanceRevaluationBatchEntity.Status` is the batch's *current* lifecycle
state. MESP-134 legitimately transitions a previously Posted batch to
`Reversed` when an exact reversal is recorded. A February reversal therefore
retroactively rewrote a January historical close evaluation from `Ready` to
`Blocked`. Current batch status is not historical accounting truth.

**The fix.** The gate now reuses the MESP-134 reconciliation authority that
`EvaluateReadinessAsync` already computes at the identical AsOfDate, so no
second revaluation engine is introduced and no extra reconciliation call is
made:

```csharp
var periodEndRevaluationLineIds = await db.RevaluationLines.AsNoTracking()
    .Where(item => item.CompanyId == companyId && item.AsOfDate == period.EndDate)
    .Select(item => item.Id).ToListAsync(cancellationToken);
var revaluation = unrealized.Any(item =>
    item.Status == FinanceEvidenceStatus.Reconciled &&
    periodEndRevaluationLineIds.Contains(item.LineId));
```

`unrealized` is `ReconcileUnrealizedFxAsync(context, companyId, period.EndDate,
cancellationToken)`. `FinanceEvidenceStatus.Reconciled` at that AsOfDate means
the original revaluation journal is effective with `PostingDate <=
period.EndDate`, its monetary evidence is valid, and it is not reversed on or
before the period end. A reversal posted after the period end leaves the
original effective and the gate satisfied; a reversal effective on or before
the period end yields `Reversed` and blocks. Missing or broken lineage yields
`PendingMapping`, so the gate fails closed and no accounting truth is
fabricated. `unrealized_fx_reconciliation` and `revaluation_policy` are now
guaranteed to agree at one AsOfDate because they read one result.
`FinanceRevaluationLineEntity` sets `AsOfDate = batch.AsOfDate` at
construction, so line-level scoping preserves the intended
`batch.AsOfDate == period.EndDate` requirement exactly.

## Regressions added

All four use real production persistence against seeded posted journals and
genuine `FinancePersistence.ReverseJournalAsync` reversals - not spies.

1. `Revaluation_readiness_is_satisfied_by_a_period_end_revaluation_effective_at_period_end`
2. `Revaluation_readiness_at_period_end_is_unchanged_by_a_revaluation_reversal_posted_after_period_end`
   - also asserts `ReconcileUnrealizedFxAsync(..., 2026-01-31)` returns the
     original as `Reconciled` with `ReversalJournalId == null`.
3. `Revaluation_readiness_is_blocked_when_the_revaluation_reversal_is_effective_by_period_end`
   - original posted 2026-01-20, real reversal posted 2026-01-28; asserts
     `Blocked` and `FinanceEvidenceStatus.Reversed` with the correct
     `ReversalJournalId`, using actual journal dates rather than batch status.
4. `Revaluation_readiness_snapshot_at_period_end_is_stable_across_a_later_revaluation_reversal`
   - compares deterministic per-check `(Code, Status, Message)` and the
     `SnapshotFingerprint` before and after a 2026-02-10 reversal.

Tests 2 and 4 fail against the previous implementation; tests 1 and 3 pin the
surrounding semantics in both directions.

## Historical MESP-135 - Sol HOLD 3 bounded remediation - accepted by Sol

This bounded remediation corrects the four remaining GPT-5.6 Sol HOLD 3
blockers on the existing Draft PR #79 / branch
`feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`. It does not redesign MESP-135, write
Jira, invoke Claude Opus, mark the PR Ready, merge, create a second PR, or
activate MESP-139 or any other capability. STOP after this handoff for
independent Sol re-review.

## HOLD 3 closure

1. **Actual SQL business races.** Added and executed `Close04_Concurrent_reopen_and_post_preserve_one_coherent_period_state` (`ReopenPeriodAsync` versus `PostJournalAsync`), `Year03_Concurrent_year_end_post_and_late_journal_cannot_commit_stale_year_end` (`PostYearEndAsync` versus `PostJournalAsync`), and `Corr03_Concurrent_correction_and_period_close_preserve_close_snapshot` (`CorrectJournalAsync` versus `ClosePeriodAsync`) with independent production persistence contexts and disposable LocalDB. Each asserts the allowed serialized outcomes and final persisted state.
2. **Historical settlement/revaluation exposure.** Settlement effects now use durable posted/reversal journal identities and posting dates plus as-of allocation history; current settlement status is not historical truth. Revaluation settlement candidates use the same durable effective-date rule.
3. **Reversed evidence mapping.** Tax, realized-FX, and unrealized-FX reconciliation require effective original/reversal journals, correct reversal lineage, and inverse monetary evidence. Valid reversals remain reconciled in the MESP-135 view; missing or invalid reversal evidence remains pending/blocked.
4. **Production AP/AR as-of regressions.** Added actual `FinanceSettlementPersistence.GetReconciliationAsync(context, companyId, asOfDate)` regressions for AP and AR control-account journal chronology, settlement posting/reversal dates, allocation dates, allocation reversals, subledger amount, posted-journal amount, difference, status, and `AsOfDate`.

## Historical MESP-135 — Sol HOLD 2 bounded remediation — final handoff for Sol re-review

This bounded remediation corrects exactly the GPT-5.6 Sol HOLD 2 findings on
the existing Draft PR #79 / branch `feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`. It
does not redesign MESP-135, does not write Jira, does not invoke Claude Opus,
does not mark the PR Ready, does not merge, does not create a second PR, and
does not activate MESP-139 or any other capability. STOP after this handoff
for independent Sol re-review.

## Repository

- HOLD 2 starting point: the accepted HOLD 1 remediation head recorded below
  in the superseded HOLD 1 section.
- Final HOLD 2 remediation head: the exact SHA returned by `git rev-parse
  HEAD` after the commit/push that follows this handoff.
- Draft PR #79 remains Open/Draft/Unmerged:
  `https://github.com/Hossam1104/mini-erp-saas-platform/pull/79`.
- `frontend/assets` is untouched.

## HOLD 2 findings and their exact resolution

1. **Blocker A — AP/AR close reconciliation as-of correctness.** Corrected so
   `FinanceSettlementPersistence` reconciliation scoping honors the requested
   accounting as-of date rather than current-state balances, with a passing
   regression test.
2. **Blocker B — missing SQL Server LocalDB concurrency race tests
   (CLOSE03, YEAR02, CORR02).** Confirmed already present with correct
   semantics in `FinanceMesp135SqlServerSafetyTests`; no additional races
   were required.
3. **Blocker C — Reporting Currency reversal sign-accounting defect.** Fixed
   in `AllocateReportingLine` so reversal lines carry the correct sign in the
   Reporting Currency allocation, not just the functional-currency side.
4. **Blocker D — MESP-134 reconciliation methods must scope by durable
   business dates.** `FinanceMesp134Persistence` reconciliation methods now
   scope strictly by durable business/accounting dates rather than row
   insertion order or current state, with 3 new regression tests.
5. **Blocker E — `QueryReconciliationAsync` missing scopes/severity logic.**
   Corrected so every reconciliation scope is evaluated and severity is
   derived from the real expected/actual/difference facts, not a partial or
   hardcoded subset.
6. **Blocker F — overly-broad `revaluation_policy` readiness check.** Narrowed
   the close-readiness check to the accounts/exposure it is actually meant to
   gate, with a corrected regression test.
7. **Blocker G — lost posting-rule lineage on correction/reversal journals.**
   Correction and reversal journal creation now preserve the originating
   posting-rule identity/version, with a corrected regression test.
8. **Blocker H — missing P&L/Balance Sheet/reconciliation CSV exports.**
   Added the three CSV export operations disclosed as a residual gap at the
   end of HOLD 1: `finance.report.profit-loss.export`,
   `finance.report.balance-sheet.export`, and
   `finance.reconciliation.close.export`. Each reuses the existing
   `Export`/`Csv` helper infrastructure and the existing
   `tenant.finance.report.export` permission code already used by the four
   HOLD-1-accepted export operations (Trial Balance, General Ledger, AP
   aging, AR aging) — no new permission was invented. Both the backend
   (`FinanceMesp135Endpoints.cs`, `FoundationRestContracts.cs`) and the
   Angular Reports workspace (`finance-reports-workspace.component.ts`,
   export links + `exportUrl()` branching for the reconciliation route and
   the `fromDate`/`toDate` vs `asOfDate` query shape) were updated.

## Section 12 — new Angular component test coverage

No `.spec.ts` file previously existed for either `finance-close-workspace`
or `finance-reports-workspace`. Both were written this session following the
established vitest + `TestBed` convention (mocked `FinanceService` via
`useValue`, `data-testid`/DOM assertions, dedicated RTL/Arabic toggle test):

- `frontend/src/app/features/finance/finance-close-workspace.component.spec.ts`
  (6 tests: cascade auto-selection and readiness evaluation, reconciliation
  evidence load scoped to the period end date, Close button gating by
  readiness status, close mutation call shape, deterministic error-code
  surfacing on a failed mutation, RTL/Arabic).
- `frontend/src/app/features/finance/finance-reports-workspace.component.spec.ts`
  (7 tests: initial trial-balance load, `exportUrl()` for trial-balance,
  P&L/Balance Sheet using `fromDate`/`toDate` not `asOfDate`, reconciliation
  export against the reconciliation route not the reports route, rendered
  export links on the P&L/Balance Sheet and reconciliation panels, RTL/Arabic).

## Files changed (HOLD 2, in addition to the HOLD 1 diff below)

- `backend/src/MiniErp.Api/FinanceMesp135Endpoints.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.App/Modules/Finance/FinanceSettlementApplicationContracts.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Contracts/Modules/Foundation/FoundationRestContracts.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Modules/Finance/FinanceMesp134Persistence.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Modules/Finance/FinanceMesp135Persistence.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Modules/Finance/FinanceSettlementPersistence.cs`
- `backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/FinanceMesp134Tests.cs`
- `backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/FinanceMesp135Tests.cs`
- `frontend/src/app/features/finance/finance-reports-workspace.component.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/features/finance/finance-close-workspace.component.spec.ts` (new)
- `frontend/src/app/features/finance/finance-reports-workspace.component.spec.ts` (new)

No entity, `DbContext`, or migration file was touched; no schema change was
required. `dotnet ef migrations list` could not run in this environment
because `MiniErp.Api` intentionally does not reference
`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` (a production-lean-build boundary, not
a defect); this is not applicable to this remediation since zero
persistence/entity changes were made.

## Final validation matrix

- Release backend build: 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Full disposable-LocalDB backend suite via the sanctioned
  `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` wrapper (includes the SQL Server safety
  harness and the REST/OpenAPI/host-security suite in the same run):
  **1,073/1,073 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** (up from the HOLD-1 baseline of
  1,065 by the Blocker D/H regression tests).
- True current public REST/OpenAPI operation catalogue count:
  **383 operations** (`FoundationOperationCatalog.PublicOperations`), up from
  380 by the exact 3 new Blocker H export operations; 2 internal operations
  unchanged.
- Targeted `FinanceMesp135Tests` + `RestFoundationTests` re-run: **47/47**
  passed, confirming the 3 new operations satisfy every generic
  catalogue-consistency assertion with zero test-file edits to
  `RestFoundationTests.cs`.
- Angular unit tests: **296/296** across 41 spec files (up from 283/39 by the
  2 new Finance component spec files).
- Production build: initial **496.45 kB** (within the 500 kB budget).
  Finance-related lazy chunks: settlement 56.04 kB, tax-fx 40.38 kB,
  finance-workspace 34.52 kB, reports-workspace 17.02 kB, close-workspace
  16.28 kB, finance-routes 821 bytes.
- Both npm audits (`npm audit`, `npm audit --omit=dev`): **0 vulnerabilities**.
- Backend NuGet packages: `dotnet list package --vulnerable
  --include-transitive` reports 0 vulnerable packages across all 5 projects.
- Full Playwright Chromium suite: **47/47 passed** (41.1s), including the
  existing MESP-135 reports/close/reconciliation specs, unmodified and
  unaffected by the Blocker H export additions.
- Runtime: restarted via `Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` with the
  exact-Development loopback `MESP_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` shortcut. Backend
  `http://localhost:5300` PID `12988`; frontend `http://localhost:4300` PID
  `4500`. HTTP 200 confirmed for `/health`, `/`, `/main.js`, and
  `/app/finance`.

## Governance and next action

No Jira writes, no Claude Opus review, no Ready transition, no merge, and no
MESP-139/next-capability activation were performed. `frontend/assets` is
untouched. Accepted fast-track remains `18/26 = 69.2%` until Sol accepts and
merges; production readiness remains approximately `47%` overall and `41%`
Procurement/P2P.

**STOP.** GPT-5.6 Sol must independently re-review this exact Draft PR #79
head for: correctness of all 8 HOLD 2 blocker resolutions above (A-H); the
new Angular component test coverage for the close and reports workspaces; the
true 383-operation catalogue count; and the complete validation evidence
above. Do not merge, mark the PR Ready, write Jira, activate MESP-139, or
start a new capability until Sol has completed this re-review.

## HOLD 1 findings and their exact resolution

1. **Close readiness must be read-only.** `EvaluateCloseReadinessAsync` in
   `FinanceMesp135Persistence.cs` no longer mutates `PeriodCloseEvidence`,
   `PeriodCloseRuns`, `PeriodHistory`, or the period version as a side effect
   of evaluation. Regression:
   `Close_readiness_is_read_only_and_does_not_create_evidence_or_history` calls
   evaluation three times and asserts zero created rows and an unchanged
   period version.
2. **As-of reconciliation.** `EvaluateReadinessAsync` and
   `QueryReconciliationAsync` now thread `asOfDate`/`period.EndDate` through to
   the MESP-134 `ReconcileTaxAsync`/`ReconcileFxAsync`/
   `ReconcileUnrealizedFxAsync`/`ReconcileReportingCurrencyAsync` overloads
   added for this purpose (old signatures delegate to the new ones with
   `null`, preserving backward compatibility). **Disclosed residual gap:**
   `FinanceSettlementPersistence.GetReconciliationAsync` (AP/AR subledger
   reconciliation) remains current-state-only; it was not given an `asOfDate`
   overload in this bounded pass and must be scoped as explicit follow-up
   work rather than silently expanded into this fix.
3. **Reporting-Currency / Cost-Center Trial Balance.** `QueryTrialBalanceAsync`
   derives opening and period facts from the already cost-center-filtered
   `group`, not an unfiltered source, using the new `ReportingAmounts` /
   `AllocateReportingLine` / `ReportingRowAmounts` / `ReportLineAmount` helpers.
4. **Profit & Loss / Balance Sheet opening correctness.** `QueryStatementAsync`
   now always zeroes P&L opening and only computes `before` (prior-period)
   facts for the Balance Sheet. During remediation testing this exposed a
   second, previously undetected defect in the same method: Balance Sheet rows
   were selected only from accounts with current-period activity (`facts`),
   silently dropping any account with a nonzero carried-forward balance but
   zero activity in the queried period. Fixed by unioning account IDs from
   both `facts` and `before` before building rows. Regression:
   `Profit_and_loss_has_zero_opening_while_balance_sheet_carries_prior_period_closing`
   posts a January journal and asserts P&L January has zero opening, Balance
   Sheet January carries the correct closing balance, and **Balance Sheet
   February** (zero activity that month) still reports the carried-forward
   opening/closing balance instead of omitting the account.
5. **Year-end reverse must reopen the closing period.** `ActYearEndAsync`'s
   reverse branch now reopens the closing period (`MarkReopened`/
   `SetState(Open)`) before posting the reversal journal;
   `CreateExactJournalReversalAsync` takes the `period` directly and fails
   with a precondition when `period.State != Open`.
6. **Year-end closing-journal-line lineage.** `CreateYearEndJournalAsync` calls
   `SetClosingJournalLine(lineId)` for every year-end line so
   `FinanceYearEndLineRecord.ClosingJournalLineId` matches the real posted
   journal line IDs.
   Regression (combined with #5):
   `Year_end_post_establishes_closing_line_lineage_and_reverse_reopens_period_for_correction`
   asserts all lines are unset before posting, all lines are set and match
   real database journal-line IDs after posting, and that reversing reopens
   the period to `Open` with an exact `ReversalOfJournalId` lineage.
7. **SQL Server safety races.** All seven named MESP-135 races
   (`Close01`-`Close03`, `Year01`-`Year02`, `Corr01`-`Corr02`) were confirmed
   present in `FinanceMesp135SqlServerSafetyTests` with the exact required
   semantics; no additional races were required by this remediation.
8. **CSV export filter parity.** `FinanceMesp135Endpoints.cs` now accepts and
   forwards the same query parameters on `trial-balance/export`,
   `general-ledger/export`, `ap-aging/export`, and `ar-aging/export` as their
   corresponding on-screen report GET endpoints (`accountId`, `costCenterId`,
   `accountFrom`, `accountTo`, `presentationCurrencyCode` for Trial Balance;
   `accountId`, `fiscalPeriodId`, `costCenterId`, `sourceContract`,
   `presentationCurrencyCode` for General Ledger; `partyId`, `currencyCode`
   for AP/AR aging). **Disclosed residual gap:** Profit & Loss and Balance
   Sheet have no CSV export endpoints at all — no `FoundationOperationCatalog`
   entry exists for `finance.report.profit-loss.export` or
   `finance.report.balance-sheet.export`. Adding them is new API surface
   (new catalog metadata, REST/OpenAPI/host-security test updates, Angular
   wiring) rather than a bounded filter-parity correction, so it was
   deliberately excluded from this remediation.

## Files changed

- `backend/src/MiniErp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Modules/Finance/FinanceMesp135Persistence.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Infrastructure/Persistence/Modules/Finance/FinanceMesp134Persistence.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.App/Modules/Finance/FinanceMesp134ApplicationContracts.cs`
- `backend/src/MiniErp.Api/FinanceMesp135Endpoints.cs`
- `backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/FinanceMesp135Tests.cs`

No entity, `DbContext`, or migration file was touched; no schema change was
required.

## Final validation matrix

- Release backend build: 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Full disposable-LocalDB backend suite via the sanctioned
  `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` wrapper (includes the SQL Server safety
  harness and the REST/OpenAPI/host-security suite in the same run):
  **1,065/1,065 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** (up from the pre-HOLD-1 baseline
  of 1,062 by the 3 new MESP-135 regression tests).
- True current public REST/OpenAPI operation catalogue count:
  **380 operations** system-wide (`FoundationOperationCatalog.PublicOperations`),
  unchanged by this remediation — no `operationId` was added or removed; the
  4 export operations only gained additional optional query parameters.
- EF pending-model-changes: clean — confirmed indirectly by the fact that no
  entity/`DbContext` file was modified in this remediation.
- Angular unit tests: **283/283** across 39 specs (unchanged from baseline).
- Production build: initial **496.45 kB** (within the 500 kB budget), lazy
  chunks unchanged, since no frontend source was modified.
- Both npm audits (`npm audit`, `npm audit --omit=dev`): **0 vulnerabilities**.
- Focused Playwright Finance suite (`e2e/finance.spec.ts`, includes the
  MESP-135 close/year-end/reports/aging/RTL specs): **15/15 passed**.
- Full Playwright Chromium suite: **47/47 passed**.
- Runtime: restarted via `Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` with the
  exact-Development loopback `MESP_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` shortcut. Backend
  `http://localhost:5300` PID `23940`; frontend `http://localhost:4300` PID
  `38732`. HTTP 200 confirmed for `/health`, `/openapi/v1.json`, `/`,
  `/main.js`, `/app/finance`, `/app/finance/ap`, `/app/finance/ar`,
  `/app/finance/settlements`, `/app/finance/tax-fx`, `/app/finance/close`, and
  `/app/finance/reports`.

## Governance and next action

No Jira writes, no Claude Opus review, no Ready transition, no merge, and no
MESP-139/next-capability activation were performed. `frontend/assets` is
untouched. Accepted fast-track remains `18/26 = 69.2%` until Sol accepts HOLD
1 and merges; production readiness remains approximately `47%` overall and
`41%` Procurement/P2P.

**STOP.** GPT-5.6 Sol must independently re-review this exact Draft PR #79
head for: correctness of all 8 HOLD 1 resolutions above (especially the
Balance Sheet carry-forward fix discovered during remediation, which was not
one of the original 8 but is directly within the scope of finding #4); the
two disclosed residual limitations (AP/AR subledger reconciliation is not yet
as-of aware; no P&L/Balance Sheet CSV export exists); the exact SQL race
names and semantics; the true 380-operation catalogue count; and the complete
validation evidence above. Do not merge, mark the PR Ready, write Jira,
activate MESP-139, or start a new capability until Sol has completed this
re-review.

# MESP-135 — GPT-5.6 Luna implementation handoff

MESP-135 is the single active Finance implementation capability under MESP-10
and is In Progress/activated. MESP-134 is Done and squash-merged to `main` at
`1e49814172843c2ec2279b8dcc5fc0a41e5da372`.

## Repository baseline

- Exact starting main: `1e49814172843c2ec2279b8dcc5fc0a41e5da372`.
- MESP-134 closure comment: `12122`.
- MESP-135 activation comment: `12123`.
- MESP-10 Finance reconciliation: `12124`.
- Implementation branch: `feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports`.
- Final feature implementation SHA: `6dca68888c4300dff2575d99b3edf919e965d783`.
- Draft PR #79 is Open/Draft/Unmerged for Sol review:
  `https://github.com/Hossam1104/mini-erp-saas-platform/pull/79`.
- `frontend/assets` is Owner-managed and must remain untouched.

## Governance and bounded scope

- No Jira writes, Claude Opus review, next-capability activation, merge, or
  Ready transition.
- Fast-track remains `18/26 = 69.2%` until Sol acceptance and merge.
- Production readiness remains approximately `47%` overall and `41%`
  Procurement/P2P; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open production gates.
- Implement Finance-owned period lifecycle/close/reopen/reclose, readiness,
  year-end, exact corrections/reversals, reconciliation, Trial Balance,
  General Ledger, AP/AR aging, and valid account-classified P&L/Balance Sheet
  reporting with bounded export. Do not activate MESP-139 generic Reporting,
  scheduling, consolidation, statutory filing, external distribution, provider
  setup, or Wafra-specific behavior.
- Reuse the MESP-132/133/134 fiscal, posting, subledger, monetary-evidence,
  revaluation, and reconciliation authorities. The server remains authoritative
  for Tenant/Company scope, permissions, accounting state, concurrency, and
  idempotency.

## Final bounded implementation handoff

- Exact starting/reconciled main: `1e49814172843c2ec2279b8dcc5fc0a41e5da372`.
- Final feature implementation: `6dca68888c4300dff2575d99b3edf919e965d783`.
- Draft PR #79 is Open/Draft/Unmerged on this branch:
  `https://github.com/Hossam1104/mini-erp-saas-platform/pull/79`.
- Activation/reconciliation: MESP-135 `12123`; Finance reconciliation `12124`.
- Architecture: Company-scoped period close/readiness with immutable evidence,
  controlled reopen/reclose, year-end calculation/post/reversal, exact posted
  journal correction/reversal, close reconciliation, Trial Balance, General
  Ledger, AP/AR aging, account-classified P&L/Balance Sheet, and deterministic
  authorized CSV export. Existing MESP-132/133/134 authorities remain the
  source of truth for fiscal state, posting, subledgers, FX/tax evidence, and
  Tenant/Company authorization.
- Migration: `20260826133441_MESP135FinanceCloseReports`; five additive tables:
  `finance.PeriodCloseEvidence`, `finance.PeriodCloseRuns`,
  `finance.PeriodHistory`, `finance.YearEndRuns`, and `finance.YearEndLines`.
- REST: 22 public operation-catalogue/OpenAPI operations under
  `/api/v1/finance/periods`, `/api/v1/finance/period-close-runs`,
  `/api/v1/finance/year-end`, `/api/v1/finance/journals/{journalId}/correction`,
  `/api/v1/finance/reconciliation/close`, and
  `/api/v1/finance/reports/{trial-balance,general-ledger,ap-aging,ar-aging,
  profit-loss,balance-sheet}` plus report exports. Read permissions are
  `tenant.finance.close.view` and `tenant.finance.report.view`; mutations use
  `tenant.finance.close.manage`, `tenant.finance.close.post`,
  `tenant.finance.correction.create`, and `tenant.finance.report.export`.
  Mutations use antiforgery, mandatory audit, required idempotency, and
  If-Match on state-changing actions.
- SQL safety: 77/77, 0 failures, 0 skips. The seven MESP-135 races are
  `Close01_Concurrent_period_close_has_one_committed_winner`,
  `Close02_Concurrent_reopen_has_one_committed_winner`,
  `Close03_Concurrent_close_and_post_reject_closed_period_journal`,
  `Year01_Concurrent_year_end_calculation_has_one_durable_snapshot`,
  `Year02_Concurrent_year_end_post_has_one_committed_journal`,
  `Corr01_Concurrent_correction_has_one_committed_reversal`, and
  `Corr02_correction_and_reversal_are_exact_and_linked`; prior MESP-133/134
  SQL coverage remains retained.
- Validation: focused MESP-135 persistence 3/3; REST/OpenAPI/host 55/55;
  disposable LocalDB full backend 1,062/1,062 with 0 failures and 0 skips;
  Angular 283/283 across 39 spec files; focused MESP-135 Playwright 5/5;
  full Chromium 47/47; EF model-change detection clean; both npm audits
  report 0 vulnerabilities.
- Build: Release 0 warnings / 0 errors; Angular initial 496.45 kB; lazy
  Finance/GL 34.52 kB, close 16.28 kB, reports 16.59 kB, and settlement
  56.04 kB.
- Runtime: backend `http://localhost:5300` PID `46612`; frontend
  `http://localhost:4300` PID `43716`. HTTP 200 probes passed for health,
  OpenAPI, root, `main.js`, `/app/finance`, AP, AR, settlements, tax-fx,
  `/app/finance/close`, and `/app/finance/reports`.
- Documentation: 70 tracked Markdown files were read/classified; live
  current-state files and `docs/staticts.md` were updated while historical and
  approved bodies were preserved. `frontend/assets` is untouched.
- Known limitations: generic Reporting/MESP-139, scheduling, consolidation,
  PDF/Excel/email distribution, statutory filing/ZATCA/FATOORA, external
  providers/bank feeds, production infrastructure, backup/restore, capacity,
  legal/specialist validation, migration/cutover, and Wafra-specific core
  behavior remain outside this bounded capability.

Sol must independently review this exact Draft PR and feature head for Tenant
and Company isolation, authoritative fiscal/posting/account classification,
period as-of semantics, year-end destination configuration, exact reversal
lineage, reconciliation truthfulness, export scope, migration safety, all seven
provider-realistic races, and the Angular EN/AR/RTL/error/authorization states.
Do not claim MESP-135 Done or set fast-track to `19/26`; stop for Sol.

## Review focus

Sol should independently inspect the final branch and Draft PR for:

1. exact MESP-119/MESP-120 evidence preservation and no client-controlled
   accounting authority;
2. Company/Tenant isolation and protected REST mutation boundaries;
3. realized FX signs and account lineage for payable/receivable allocations;
4. revaluation as-of semantics, active-batch blocking, and exact reversals;
5. policy/tax/revaluation idempotency, audit, concurrency, and migration;
6. the Angular workflow’s real loading, empty, blocked, evidence, and RTL
   behavior; and
7. the explicit boundary around supplier-declared tax, statutory returns,
   external providers, and production gates.

## Governance

- No Jira writes were performed by this implementation session.
- MESP-134 remains the only active capability under MESP-10.
- MESP-135 remains inactive and is not activated by this handoff.
- Accepted fast-track completion remains `17/26 = 65.4%` until Sol acceptance
  and merge; production readiness remains approximately `47%` overall and
  `41%` Procurement/P2P.
- GPT-5.6 Sol decides acceptance, any follow-up remediation, merge readiness,
  Jira closure/reconciliation, and the next exact session.

## HOLD 2 final remediation evidence

### Allocation monetary evidence

The old defective calculation summed debit transaction values but summed every
absolute functional line magnitude. The corrected allocation journal derives
functional debit and credit totals independently, asserts transaction and
functional balance with the approved precision helper, and stores one balanced
functional side as both the functional-currency transaction amount and
functional amount. The rate evidence is null because the journal is already in
Company functional currency. Payable realized-FX loss, payable realized-FX
gain, receivable direction, exact allocation reversal, reporting derivation,
and `ReconcileFxAsync` coverage inspect the persisted evidence and actual lines.

### SQL REV03

`MESP134_sql_server_REV03_revaluation_post_vs_source_mutation_fails_closed_or_commits_consistently`
now races production `PostRevaluationBatchAsync` against production
`CreateAllocationAsync` for the same OpenItem, through independent Finance
persistence instances, DbContexts, and SQL connections. The final assertions
correlate original amount, active allocation and outstanding balance, batch
status, immutable source snapshot/fingerprint, revaluation and allocation
journal counts, realized-FX effect, and balanced GL lines. Revaluation-first
and allocation-first serializations are both checked; allocation-first cannot
leave a stale Posted revaluation or duplicate source effect.

### Direct regressions

The focused direct suite uses real `FinanceMesp134Persistence` and
`FinanceSettlementPersistence` behavior against disposable module stores. It
contains TAX-EVIDENCE-01 through 06 for exact, mismatch, ambiguous,
insufficient, and date/currency cases; HIST-FX-01 through 06 for exact
historical identity, missing identity, wrong version ID, wrong version number,
wrong pair, wrong rate, and later-current-version preservation; realized gain
and loss allocation/reconciliation/reversal persistence tests; and revaluation
calculate/post, real source change after calculation, and exact reversal tests.
Focused total is `24/24`.

### Bilingual Finance errors

The Tax/FX workspace maps exact production codes to `[English, Arabic]` pairs
through the existing `LanguageService`, including
`unsupported_revaluation_scope` rather than the stale
`revaluation_scope_invalid` key. Angular assertions cover exact-rate,
reporting-rate, supplier-tax, realized-FX mapping, stale-source, active prior
revaluation, scope, concurrency, and idempotency outcomes in both languages,
including meaningful Arabic text and RTL restoration.

### Markdown and final handoff

All `69` tracked Markdown files were read and classified as A live/current
control records, B active-capability records, C approved architecture/BRD or
contract records, or D historical/deprecated/supporting records. Live records
were reconciled while historical HOLD 1 evidence was preserved. The final
branch head is the exact SHA returned by `git rev-parse HEAD` after the final
documentation/tracker push; the source/test commit is
`550c9a7ccf1a7d5d3115efc495a289d80a63bb4c`. PR #78 description is updated with
the final evidence and remains Draft/Open/Unmerged. No Jira writes, Opus,
Ready transition, merge, or MESP-135 activation occurred.

## Historical MESP-133 GPT-5.6 Sol verification-only HOLD 4 handoff

HOLD 4 adds acceptance regressions only, then stops for GPT-5.6 Sol. Do not
merge, mark PR #77 Ready, write Jira, activate MESP-134/MESP-135, invoke Opus,
create another PR, or start another capability.

## Repository

- Branch: `feat/MESP-133-ap-ar-cash-settlement`; PR #77; base `main`.
- PR #77 remains Open, Draft, and Unmerged.
- Original main baseline: `9ace42c7a830b5ef155a26b18d4a888676b8c188`.
- HOLD 4 starting SHA: `30ea4a04e5fb120a292083edc03073e37b278b11`.

  after the final documentation push and reported in the completion response.
- Starting branch/origin heads matched the required HOLD 4 SHA; no rebase,

## HOLD 4 verification evidence

The real `ProcurementFinanceSupplierInvoiceSourceProvider` was instantiated
directly with bounded fakes for its authoritative handoff, match, company,
purchase-order, payment-term, and Supplier persistence dependencies. The exact
focused tests are:

- `Procurement_source_ready_returns_active_supplier_with_trusted_invoice_date`:
  source and list both return the active Supplier; Tenant/Company, trusted
  invoice date, exact PO Payment Term version, due date, and match identity are
  asserted from authoritative evidence.
- `Procurement_source_ready_excludes_missing_inactive_and_cross_tenant_suppliers`:
  missing, inactive, and wrong-Tenant Suppliers each return `null` from
  `FindAsync` and are absent from `ListAsync`.
- `Procurement_source_ready_never_uses_handoff_created_at_as_invoice_date`:
  missing SupplierInvoiceDate with a usable handoff `CreatedAt` fails closed.
- `Procurement_source_ready_fails_closed_for_unsupported_payment_term_base_date`:
  ReceiptDate basis fails closed without current-date, GR-date, or PO-date
  substitution.

The historical Finance regression is
`Historical_recognition_uses_rule_effective_on_document_date_without_reinterpreting_prior_item`.
Recognition Posting Rule A (`2026-01-01` through `2026-03-31`) posts the
February item to AP Control A; Rule B (`2026-04-01` onward) posts the May item
to AP Control B. The test inspects actual recognition journal lines, asserts
both journal IDs, asserts reconciliation is `Reconciled`, and asserts no
`PendingMapping`. The existing
`Historical_reconciliation_preserves_ap_and_ar_lineage_after_rule_change_and_allocation_reversal`
test remains retained and passing, including mismatch, correct allocation,
reversal, outstanding restoration, and reconciliation assertions.

Direct recognition fail-closed tests for missing, inactive, and cross-Tenant
authoritative Suppliers remain present. Production code was unchanged.

## Final validation

- Focused Finance remediation: `16/16`.
- REST/OpenAPI/host: `54/54`.
- Full backend disposable LocalDB: `1014/1014`, `0` failed, `0` skipped.
- SQL Server safety: `61/61`, `0` failed, `0` skipped; all 15 MESP-133 SQL
  races retained.
- Release build: `0` warnings / `0` errors.
- Angular: `274/274` across 38 spec files; focused settlement workspace
  `15/15`.
- Production bundle: initial `496.44 kB`; Finance/GL lazy `34.31 kB`; settlement
  lazy `56.04 kB`; initial remains under the 500 kB budget.
- Both npm audits: `0 vulnerabilities`.
- Playwright Chromium: focused Finance `6/6`; full `38/38`.
- Runtime: backend PID `32024` and frontend PID `1164`; `/health`, `/`,
  `/main.js`, `/app/finance`, `/app/finance/ap`, `/app/finance/ar`, and
  `/app/finance/settlements` all returned HTTP `200`.
- Markdown audit: all 68 tracked Markdown files were read; live current-state,
  task, README, Run.md, architecture/plan, and tracker records were reconciled;
  historical bodies were preserved; `frontend/assets` is untouched.

## Sol HOLD 2 resolution A-G

### A - allocation versus settlement reversal race

The missing provider-realistic SQL race is implemented in
`backend/tests/MiniErp.ArchitectureTests/SqlServerSafetyTests.cs` as
`MESP133_sql_server_allocation_vs_settlement_reversal_race_has_one_valid_serialization`.
It uses independent Finance persistence/DbContext paths, starts allocation and
settlement reversal concurrently, and verifies the committed database state:
either the allocation remains active and the settlement remains Posted, or the
settlement is Reversed exactly once with zero active allocations. The full
disposable SQL suite passes `61/61`.

### B - historical Receipt reversal/as-of semantics

`FinanceSettlementPersistence.GetExposureAsync` and its reusable effective
settlement helper now use PostedJournalId/PostingDate and
ReversalJournalId/PostingDate rather than current document status. The focused
test `Receipt_exposure_uses_posted_and_reversal_journal_dates_for_as_of_truth`
proves before-posting exclusion, between-posting-and-reversal inclusion, and
on-reversal-date removal.

### C - Payment/Receipt route integrity

`IFinanceSettlementPersistence.GetSettlementDocumentAsync`,
`FinanceSettlementPersistence`, and `FinanceSettlementEndpoints` accept and
enforce `FinancePaymentMethodDirection? expectedDirection`; wrong-direction
detail reads return the same not-found behavior as an absent resource. The
focused direction test covers both wrong Payment-on-Receipt and wrong
Receipt-on-Payment routes; REST/OpenAPI/host validation is `54/54`.

### D - historical AP/AR reconciliation lineage

`FinanceSettlementPersistence` now derives control accounts from each
OpenItem.RecognitionJournalId and actual Journal lines, uses explicit
allocation and reversal JournalIds, validates allocation Posting Rule sides
against the historical account, and fails closed with
`posting_rule_control_account_mismatch`. Reversal posts against the original
allocation lineage. No current effective Posting Rule is used to reinterpret
posted history. Focused Finance coverage is `7/7`; the SQL suite includes
allocation over-allocation, allocation reversal, settlement reversal, and the
new cross-operation race.

### E - manual AR Payment Term fail-closed behavior

`FinanceSettlementPersistence.ResolvePaymentTermAsync` requires a server-owned
Payment Term, resolves the exact effective version, derives the due date only
from supported trusted base-date semantics, and treats a client DueDate only as
a consistency assertion. Missing term returns `payment_term_not_configured`;
disagreement returns `payment_term_snapshot_mismatch`; unsupported bases fail
closed. The focused suite covers missing term with explicit due date and
historical due-date behavior.

### F - AP source-ready contract

`ProcurementFinanceSupplierInvoiceSourceProvider.ListAsync`,
`FinanceSettlementPersistence.ListApSourceReadyAsync`, and
`FinanceSettlementEndpoints` replace the empty source-ready stub with an
authorized, Company-filtered query over trusted MESP-126 match/term evidence.
Ineligible, cancelled, already-recognized, cross-Company, and unsupported-term
candidates are excluded without exposing raw browser evidence IDs as discovery
authority. The Angular AP source-ready table recognizes an eligible candidate
and refreshes the resulting open-item evidence.

### G - Angular operational journey

`finance-settlement-workspace.component.ts`, `finance.service.ts`, and
`finance.model.ts` add bounded AP source-ready recognition, manual AR creation
with Customer/Payment Term selectors and derived due date, Payment/Receipt
creation with Supplier/Customer, manual Payment Method, and Cash/Bank
selectors, valid lifecycle actions, compatible allocation selection, partial
allocation, explicit allocation reversal, deterministic backend error mapping,
and EN/AR/RTL coverage. No raw GUID entry or Wafra branch was added. Focused
Finance Playwright is `5/5`; the full Chromium suite is `37/37`.

## Accounting and approval boundaries

- AP remains MESP-126 trusted-source recognition with historical term/version
  snapshots and no invented Net-30.
- AR requires Payment Term and server-derived due date.
- `IFinanceSourceApprovalPolicy` remains authoritative for Required,
  NotRequired, and NotConfigured settlement behavior; SoD/self-approval stays
  fail-closed.
- Non-manual/provider-style methods fail with `payment_method_not_supported`.
- Cash/Bank `LinkedAccountId` is authoritative and must match the selected
  Posting Rule cash side.
- Posted settlements and allocations are immutable; corrections use explicit
  reversal lineage.
- Accounting-date as-of aging/exposure excludes future effects and nets only
  after the effective reversal posting date.

## SQL Server safety

The safe wrapper `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1` ran against disposable
LocalDB `MiniErpFoundation_*`: **61 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The exact
MESP-133 race names are:

- `MESP133_sql_server_payment_method_same_code_race_is_unique_or_safe_conflict`
- `MESP133_sql_server_payment_method_lifecycle_race_has_one_committed_transition`
- `MESP133_sql_server_cash_account_same_code_race_is_unique_or_safe_conflict`
- `MESP133_sql_server_cash_account_lifecycle_race_has_one_committed_transition`
- `MESP133_sql_server_payment_method_edit_same_version_race_has_one_authoritative_edit`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_ap_source_concurrent_recognition_has_one_source_effect`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_payable_open_item_concurrent_allocation_cannot_over_allocate`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_settlement_concurrent_allocations_cannot_over_allocate_document`
- `MESP133_sql_server_settlement_post_and_payment_method_lifecycle_have_one_consistent_order`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_settlement_submit_version_race_has_one_transition`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_payment_concurrent_post_has_one_authoritative_journal`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_receipt_concurrent_post_has_one_authoritative_journal`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_posted_settlement_concurrent_reversal_has_one_reversal_lineage`
- `MESP133_sql_server_same_allocation_concurrent_reversal_has_one_active_state_transition`
- `MESP133_sql_server_allocation_vs_settlement_reversal_race_has_one_valid_serialization`

The migration/model checks remain green in the full suite. Existing additive
migration `20260824220208_MESP133ApArCashSettlement` was not edited; no
cosmetic migration was created.

## Validation

- Release build: 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Focused `FinanceSettlementRemediationTests`: 7/7.
- REST/OpenAPI/host: 54/54.
- Full backend: 1005/1005, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Angular: 270/270 across 38 spec files, including focused settlement workspace
  coverage 11/11.
- Production bundle: initial 496.43 kB; Finance/GL lazy 34.31 kB; settlement
  lazy 47.13 kB; unchanged initial budget <=500 kB.
- Playwright: focused Finance 5/5; full Chromium 37/37.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`: 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: 0 vulnerabilities.
- Tracked Markdown: 68 files; live records reconciled, approved/historical
  bodies preserved.

## Runtime

Repository-owned processes remain running: API `http://localhost:5300` PID
`39276`; Angular `http://localhost:4300` PID `26888`. HTTP 200 probes passed
for `/health`, `/`, `/main.js`, `/app/finance`, `/app/finance/ap`,
`/app/finance/ar`, and `/app/finance/settlements`. Development bypass,
authenticated session, entry, and module-registration probes returned 200;
the browser exercised the AP source-ready recognition journey against
controlled Development data/routes.

## Jira and boundaries

No Jira writes by Luna. Sol HOLD 2: `11926`; Finance Epic reconciliation:
`11927`; manual-AR supplemental finding: `11928`. MESP-133 remains In
Progress/activated, accepted fast-track remains 16/26 = 61.5%, and production
readiness remains approximately 47% overall / 41% Procurement/P2P. MESP-134
and MESP-135 were not started. No Opus, no merge, no provider credentials,
no Wafra-specific behavior, and `frontend/assets` is untouched.

## Next Action

STOP. Return the exact new branch head to GPT-5.6 Sol for independent review.

# Historical pre-HOLD 2 MESP-133 handoff

This bounded remediation session is complete. The original implementation and
acceptance remediation are on the focused branch below; Draft PR #77 remains
Open/Draft/Unmerged for GPT-5.6 Sol's independent re-review. Do not merge,
mark Ready, start MESP-134/MESP-135, write Jira, or invoke Opus automatically.

## Starting Main SHA

`9ace42c7a830b5ef155a26b18d4a888676b8c188` (exact `main` and
`origin/main` baseline before branch creation).

## Branch

`feat/MESP-133-ap-ar-cash-settlement`

## Original Implementation SHA

`3a579e3ad66378d3537e3f1bdb2b7d15954481c2` - original source and test
implementation commit.

## Sol-Reviewed Starting Head

`f30537d38106065891794a583b905a6fecd44d61` - exact Sol-reviewed head from
which this remediation was started.

## Remediation Implementation SHA

The source/test remediation commit is
`b9eba368922899165324086aa59298d054fec25d`, created from the Sol-reviewed
head. The final branch SHA is the subsequent
documentation/tracker handoff commit, verified with `git rev-parse HEAD` and
`origin/feat/MESP-133-ap-ar-cash-settlement` after push.

## Final Branch SHA

The final branch head is the documentation/tracker handoff commit after this
implementation commit. The exact value is recorded by `git rev-parse HEAD` in
the completion report and must be verified by Sol after push.

## Draft PR

- **Number:** `#77`
- **State:** **Open / Draft / Unmerged**
- **Head:** `feat/MESP-133-ap-ar-cash-settlement`
- **Base:** `main`
- **Mergeability:** Do not merge or mark ready in this session; GPT-5.6 Sol
  owns the independent review and merge recommendation.

## Repository Architecture Findings

MESP-133 is implemented inside the existing Tenant-authorized, Company-scoped
Finance module. The new module-owned persistence consists of payment methods,
cash accounts, open items, settlement documents, and allocations, with additive
migration `20260824220208_MESP133ApArCashSettlement`. Tenant ownership filters
and verification cover all new entities. REST mutation handlers use the
existing trusted-context, authorization, anti-forgery, idempotency, audit,
optimistic-concurrency, and OpenAPI foundations. Angular adds lazy AP, AR, and
settlement routes under `/app/finance` with EN/AR/RTL presentation.

## Sol blockers 1-7

1. **AP recognition:** `ProcurementFinanceSupplierInvoiceSourceProvider` now
   resolves the exact Purchase Order payment-term identity/code/version using
   trusted Procurement and Payment Term persistence, validates the historical
   term version, and derives/snapshots the due date. Missing, cancelled,
   unsupported, or ineligible MESP-126 evidence fails closed.
2. **Approval:** settlement approval/posting consumes the existing
   `IFinanceSourceApprovalPolicy`; Required, NotRequired, and NotConfigured
   behavior is explicit, and self-approval remains forbidden.
3. **Methods:** create/edit/use rejects `IsManual=false` with deterministic
   `payment_method_not_supported`; only internal Company-owned manual methods
   are usable.
4. **Cash/GL:** payment/receipt posting verifies the selected Cash/Bank
   `LinkedAccountId` against the correct side of the configured Posting Rule,
   with lifecycle/effective-date/currency revalidation and fail-closed mismatch.
5. **Reconciliation:** AP/AR compares active subledger outstanding balances
   with actual posted/reversed control-account journal lines; Cash/Bank compares
   settlement movement with the configured linked GL account. Missing or
   inconsistent mappings are PendingMapping; no balancing plug is created.
6. **As-of reporting:** reusable effective-allocation filtering applies
   accounting dates and later reversal dates to aging and customer exposure;
   future allocations/receipts are excluded.
7. **Integrity:** AP/AR detail and payment/receipt actions enforce kind and
   direction; rejected edits return to Draft through the supported resubmission
   path.

## Accounts Payable

AP recognizes only the existing MESP-126 Finance-ready supplier-invoice
handoff. Held, unresolved, non-comparable, rejected, or pending evidence is
not recognized. Payment-term and due-date evidence is snapshotted from the
authoritative historical Purchase Order/Payment Term version; there is no
hardcoded Net-30 fallback. A legitimate Finance-ready source can become an AP
open item, while missing/untrusted/ineligible term or matching evidence fails
closed with deterministic domain errors.

## docs/staticts.md

The tracked statistics file was read and updated directly. The production
headline remains approximately 47%, Procurement/P2P approximately 41%, and
accepted fast-track remains 16/26 = 61.5% because this PR is Draft and
unmerged. The 25 August progress row records the exact base, Sol-reviewed
head, remediation validation counts, runtime/API probes, and unchanged
boundaries.

## Documentation

`docs/36_MESP-133_AP_AR_Cash_Settlement_Architecture.md` records the bounded
scope, remediation contracts, authorization, AP/AR source terms, approval,
payment/allocation/reversal invariants, posting/GL lineage, persistence,
API/UI routes, validation, and deferred scope. All 68 tracked Markdown files
were read; live files were reconciled while approved and historical content
was preserved. `frontend/assets` is untouched.

## TASK.md

This MESP-133 handoff is now the top current session record. The historical
MESP-132 handoff remains below it for traceability. The next action is Sol's
independent review of Draft PR #77, not automatic execution of another
capability.

## PR Description

Draft PR #77 describes the reusable AP/AR/cash/payment/receipt/settlement
spine, its fail-closed boundaries, MESP-132 Posting Rule/journal lineage,
additive migration, and validation evidence. It remains open and Draft.

## Validation Evidence

- Focused backend remediation: `5/5` `FinanceSettlementRemediationTests`.
- REST/OpenAPI/host validation: `54/54`; the remediation adds an explicit
  settlement-operation security-contract test plus route and direction
  assertions in the focused backend suite and full validation.
- SQL Server safety: `60/60`, using disposable `MiniErpFoundation_*` LocalDB
  databases via `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING`; the five retained
  MESP-133 configuration races remain, plus nine financial races: AP source
  recognition, open-item over-allocation, cash-document over-allocation,
  settlement post/lifecycle ordering, submit-version ordering, same-payment
  post, same-receipt post, posted-settlement reversal, and allocation-reversal
  lineage.
- Full backend: `1002/1002`, failed `0`, skipped `0`; Release build `0 warnings /
  0 errors`.
- Angular: `261/261` across 38 spec files; production initial bundle
  `496.43 kB`, Finance/GL lazy `34.31 kB`, settlement lazy `23.95 kB`.
- Playwright: focused Finance `4/4`; full Chromium `36/36`; both npm audits
  report `0 vulnerabilities`.
- Runtime: backend health `http://localhost:5300/health`, frontend root,
  `main.js`, `/app/finance`, `/app/finance/ap`, `/app/finance/ar`, and
  `/app/finance/settlements` returned HTTP 200. Development-authenticated
  `GET /api/v1/finance/companies` returned HTTP 200. Repository-owned runtime
  PIDs are backend `39624` and frontend `8508`.
- Migration/model drift: existing additive migration
  `20260824220208_MESP133ApArCashSettlement` was not edited or replaced; no
  new migration was required and Release model/build validation is clean.

## Jira

MESP-133 remains In Progress / activated under Epic MESP-10. Activation
comment: `11859`. MESP-10 activation comment: `11860`. No Jira writes were
performed during this implementation session.

### Writes Performed

No Jira writes, external provider configuration, credentials, production
configuration, DNS/TLS changes, migration execution against a production
database, or asset changes were performed.

## Opus

### Review Performed

No Claude Opus review was performed and no Opus prompt was added. The required
next reviewer is GPT-5.6 Sol.

## Explicit Deferred Scope

MESP-134 FX/exchange-rate setup; tax/VAT/ZATCA/FATOORA; Sales lifecycle;
external bank feeds, payment gateways, and providers; supplier/customer
portals; statements; fixed assets; payroll; treasury; generic Reporting;
production provider setup; backup/restore, capacity, legal, specialist,
migration/cutover, external/statutory, and Wafra-specific core gates remain
open or deferred. Posted documents and allocations remain immutable and use
explicit reversals. No production-readiness or merged-capability increase is
claimed from this Draft PR.

## Next Step

GPT-5.6 Sol reviews the complete focused diff and evidence, with special focus
on AP term/source fail-closed behavior, Company/Tenant isolation, Posting Rule
and GL lineage, settlement/allocation/reversal invariants, concurrency races,
and additive migration safety. Sol then recommends merge or remediation and
reconciles Jira; this branch must remain open/unmerged until that decision.

## Historical MESP-132 final source-authority and SQL-concurrency remediation pending Sol acceptance

Public manual Journal requests no longer accept source contract/event/evidence,
Posting Rule, or amount-authority fields; the server forces the manual source
identity and preserves trusted source-generated lineage on the separate
Inventory handoff path. SQL Server provider-realistic races cover period close
versus post, account restriction versus post, same-Journal post, same-source
Inventory handoff processing, and first-company JournalSequence allocation.

omission of Blocked events; correction BaseUnitCost evidence semantics; and
mixed-functional-currency summary guard.

MESP-131 still requires Jira closure by Sol. MESP-132 is **not yet
activated**. No Finance, GL, AP, AR, Sales, generic Reporting,
migration/cutover, or downstream implementation was started.

### Next action - Sol governance

Sol must:

1. Verify merged `main` SHA `a8664d6a0d006e463a1a03fadd76c28475475f58`.
2. Record final MESP-131 Jira closure.
3. Move MESP-131 to Done.
4. Reconcile the MESP-8 Inventory Epic.
5. Evaluate and activate MESP-132 as the next implementation capability.
6. Issue the next Luna xHigh execution prompt.

Do not put the MESP-132 implementation prompt in `TASK.md`; Sol writes it
after governance closure.

## MESP-131 FINAL OPUS P1 QUANTITY-CORRECTION REMEDIATION HANDOFF - 24 August 2026

### Starting SHA

`5bf94cdf48e3f103e58c3b13c20c5824b55d785a`

### Implementation SHA

`64c4f4ea9b917119d07cb26df7ecac8c2239bfac`

### Final Branch SHA

The final documentation handoff tip is reported in the completion response
after this bounded session is committed and pushed. The implementation tip
above is the exact source/test delta SHA on
`feat/MESP-131-mwa-valuation-reconciliation`.

### PR #75 State

Open, Draft, unmerged, base `main`; the existing PR is reused. The Opus P1
finding source is Jira comment `11835`, and Sol's latest acceptance hold is
comment `11839`. No Jira writes were performed.

### Exact source fix

`MovingWeightedAverageCalculator.TryApplyCorrection` now computes correction
quantity as exact physical ledger arithmetic: inbound uses
`priorQuantity + quantity`, outbound uses `priorQuantity - quantity`, and
neither operand nor result uses monetary `AmountScale`. Monetary values still
round through `AmountScale`, including `PriorValue`, reversal values, formula
reversal values, rounding adjustments, `NewValue`, and the derived average
unit cost through its configured unit-cost precision.

### Fractional correction regression

The product-reachable SQLite valuation regression uses SAR, UnitCostScale 2,
and AmountScale 2: inbound `1.004 @ 100.00` produces `1.004 / 100.40`, a
positive Stock Adjustment `+0.001` at CurrentMovingAverage produces
`1.005 / 100.50 / 100.00`, and its normal outbound physical correction of
`0.001` produces:

- Prior quantity `1.005`;
- correction quantity `0.001`, Direction `Outbound`;
- exact event arithmetic `1.005 - 0.001 = 1.004`;
- ReversalValue/BaseAmount `0.10`, SignedBaseAmount `-0.10`, BaseUnitCost
  `100.00`;
- New quantity `1.004`, NewValue `100.40`, and AverageUnitCost `100.00`;
- final valuation state `1.004 / 100.40 / 100.00`;
- physical/valued quantity difference `0` and reconciliation `Reconciled`.

The direct calculator regression uses Outbound `0.001`, PriorQuantity
`1.005`, PriorValue `100.50`, ReversalValue `0.10`, UnitCostScale `2`, and
AmountScale `2`; it asserts `NewQuantity = 1.004`, `NewValue = 100.40`, and no
error.

### P1 preservation

The drifted-correction case remains fail-closed with
`correction_would_orphan_residual_value`, Blocked evidence, unchanged
affected state, and unrelated Company pools continuing. Existing ordinary
fractional inbound/outbound/full-depletion, exact event arithmetic, Finance
handoff reconstruction, and `0.005` reconciliation-mismatch regressions
remain unchanged and passing.

### Schema / migration status

No schema or migration changed. Existing quantity storage remains
`decimal(28,8)`, and the accepted final migration remains
`20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity`.

### Final validation

- Focused MESP-131 valuation: `44/44`, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Combined Inventory ledger/stock-control/valuation regression: `89/89`, 0
  failed, 0 skipped.
- SQL Server safety: `40/40` against disposable LocalDB.
- Full backend: `963/963`, 0 failed, 0 skipped, through the safe disposable
  LocalDB runner.
- Release solution build: `0` warnings, `0` errors.
- Frontend source unchanged; accepted Angular evidence remains `254/254`,
  initial bundle `499.94 kB`, valuation lazy chunk `35.96 kB`, focused
  Chromium `5/5`, full Chromium `32/32`, and both npm audits at `0
  vulnerabilities`.
- `git diff --check` clean; `frontend/assets` has no changes.

### Runtime evidence

- Backend URL `http://localhost:5300`, PID `44188`, `/health` HTTP 200.
- Frontend URL `http://localhost:4300`, PID `20316`, `/` HTTP 200 and
  `/main.js` HTTP 200.
- Both repository-owned processes were restarted by the official launcher and
  left running for Owner inspection. Credentials were not printed.

### Deferred Opus P2 findings

The four Opus P2 observations remain deferred: pre-first-process ScopeMode
transition; `/valuation/pending` omission of Blocked; correction BaseUnitCost
evidence semantics; and the mixed-functional-currency summary guard. No P3
item was changed, no P2-3 expansion was performed, and no MESP-132 or
downstream implementation was started.

### Next step

Sol final delta verification of the exact branch SHA, followed by bounded
Claude Opus 5 re-review. Do not insert the Opus prompt or start MESP-132.

## OPUS P1 Remediation Acceptance Handoff - 24 August 2026

### Starting SHA

`33e002806f8eeefe545ff0f33f281bccb3862be0`

### P1 Remediation SHA

`5908ce2645929c0881e4fd7e9ebf0d9b67d4acb1`

### Final Branch SHA

The final documentation handoff tip is reported in the completion response
after this bounded session. The branch remains
`feat/MESP-131-mwa-valuation-reconciliation`.

### PR #75 State

Open, Draft, unmerged, base `main`. Opus finding source: Jira comment
`11835`. No rebase, force-push, merge, Ready-for-Review transition, or new PR
was performed.

### P1-1 Drifted-Average Correction

The exact reproduced sequence is: SAR policy with UnitCostScale 2 and
AmountScale 2; inbound 10 @ 10.00; positive +10 Stock Adjustment valued at
the current MWA with original value 100; inbound 20 @ 20.00; outbound Stock
Issue 30 @ MWA 15, leaving quantity 10/value 150; then a physical outbound
correction of the original +10 adjustment. The exact reversal value is 100,
which would otherwise calculate quantity 0/value 50.

`MovingWeightedAverageCalculator.TryApplyCorrection` now returns `false`
with `correction_would_orphan_residual_value` for zero quantity with residual
value. The normal persistence path records the correction as `Blocked` with
that status/reason before state apply, preserves the affected state at
10/150, adds the valuation scope to `stoppedValuationScopes`, and records the
same-scope successor as `pending_predecessor`. The deterministic pre-`Apply`
state invariant check remains defense in depth; no broad exception swallowing
or silent value rebaseline was introduced.

The same regression includes a second Product pool in the same Company. Its
eligible inbound movement is `Applied`, proving the blocked correction does
not become a Company-wide infrastructure failure. No invalid quantity/value
state is persisted and the original immutable adjustment remains valued at
100.

### P1-2 Physical Quantity Precision

`AmountScale` is no longer used for input, prior, new, correction, or
difference quantity arithmetic. Physical quantity remains the authoritative
Stock Ledger `decimal(28,8)` fact; no customer-configured QuantityScale was
introduced. `UnitCostScale` and `AmountScale` remain active for unit costs and
true monetary values, including movement formula values, closeout rounding
bridges, actual movement values, and Finance handoff amounts.

The regressions prove inbound `1.005 @ 100.00` persists quantity `1.005` with
movement/base amount `100.50`; outbound `0.005` preserves the physical
quantity and values it at `0.50`; full fractional depletion closes to
quantity/value/average zero with formula `100.50` and rounding adjustment
zero; event prior/quantity/new arithmetic is internally consistent; Finance
handoff Quantity/BaseUnitCost/BaseAmount/SignedBaseAmount reconstruct the
fractional amount; and exact reconciliation detects physical `1.005` versus
valued `1.000` as `QuantityMismatch` with difference `0.005`, not a false
reconciliation.

### Schema / Migration Status

No schema migration was required for this P1 remediation. Existing quantity
columns already persist `decimal(28,8)`. The prior approved additive final EF
migration `20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity` remains unchanged;
the preceding MESP-131 migrations remain unchanged.

### Validation

- Focused MESP-131 valuation: `42/42`, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- Combined Inventory ledger/stock-control/valuation regression: `87/87`, 0
  failed, 0 skipped.
- SQL Server safety: `40/40` against disposable `MiniErpFoundation_*`
  LocalDB through `MESP_SQLSERVER_SAFETY_CONNECTION_STRING` only.
- Full backend: `961/961`, 0 failed, 0 skipped, through the safe disposable
  LocalDB runner.
- Release solution build: `0` warnings, `0` errors.
- Frontend source was unchanged; Angular remained `254/254` across 35 spec
  files; production initial bundle `499.94 kB`, valuation lazy chunk
  `35.96 kB`.
- Focused MESP-131 Chromium: `5/5`; full Chromium: `32/32`.
- Production-only and full npm audits: `0 vulnerabilities`.
- Runtime after official launcher restart: backend `5300`, PID `16088`,
  frontend `4300`, PID `43800`; `/health`, `/`, and `/main.js` each HTTP
  200; both processes alive; no credentials printed.
- `git diff --check`: clean before the documentation handoff commit.
- `frontend/assets`: zero changes.

### Deferred Opus P2 Findings

The four non-blocking observations from Jira `11835` remain deferred and were
not expanded into this P1 remediation: scope-mode transition before first
valuation process; `/valuation/pending` omission of Blocked events; outbound
correction evidence displaying current MWA rather than original event cost;
and the missing mixed-functional-currency summary guard.

Sol owns independent delta acceptance and review routing. No Opus prompt is
created by this handoff.

## Sol Delta Acceptance Handoff

The remediation implementation is complete for Sol review. The exact bounded
delta includes:

- LedgerSequence-authoritative mutation ordering, with AsOf mutation removal
  and unsafe TrackingIdentity process filters removed;
- policy-pool continuity and monotonic policy versioning, including compatible
  carry-forward and fail-closed incompatible transitions;
- durable missing-policy predecessor evidence and same-pool blocking;
- empty-state positive CurrentMovingAverage guard;
- outbound use of the persisted prior rounded average and configured precision;
- exact full correction reversal and deterministic partial correction;
- conserved InTransit quantity/value for receipt, loss, and return resolution;
- bounded SHA-256 REST/correction fingerprints, durable process/policy replay,
  real conflict semantics, and first-scope concurrency safety;
- Finance Direction, absolute non-negative BaseAmount, SignedBaseAmount, and
  `inventory-valuation-finance.v1` contract semantics;
- dedicated multi-Product Warehouse summary, explicit Partial/Pending/Blocked
  truthfulness, safe current-state reconciliation filters, and complete pending
  counts;
- Angular aggregate-summary, pending-state, Finance-handoff, EN/AR/RTL, and
  lazy-route truthfulness.

The additive migration, focused MESP-131 tests, SQL Server/LocalDB safety tests,
full backend suite, Angular suite, focused and full Chromium suites, bundle
budget, npm audits, runtime restart/HTTP evidence, and protected asset check
are the acceptance evidence for the exact final branch tip. Sol owns the next
independent delta acceptance; do not start downstream implementation.

## MESP-131 Final EF Migration Artifact Repair

This bounded migration-only repair session started from exact SHA
`48ddf07a645da0130699314243ae8b23907b3bfc`, with required `main` base
`b470179e1d18ef75c0a9247b2340407da6220dc4`, on the existing feature branch and
Draft PR #75. It did not write Jira, restart the Owner runtime, modify Angular,
touch `frontend/assets`, alter the preceding MESP-131 migrations, or start
MESP-132.

The defect was the final EF Designer artifact
`20260823211902_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity.Designer.cs` having an empty
`BuildTargetModel`. The malformed timestamped migration pair was removed and
the final migration was regenerated through the actual EF tooling as
`20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity`, including a populated
Designer target model and the exact additive schema delta:

- `inventory.MovementValuationEvents.FormulaMovementValue`, nullable
  `decimal(28,8)`;
- `inventory.MovementValuationEvents.RoundingAdjustmentAmount`, nullable
  `decimal(28,8)`; and
- `inventory.FinanceValuationHandoffs.RoundingAdjustmentAmount`, required
  `decimal(28,8)` with default `0`.

The preceding migrations
`20260823124304_MESP131MovingWeightedAverageValuation` and
`20260823180537_MESP131SolFinancialIntegrityRemediation` remain unchanged.
The SQL safety suite gained one metadata regression proving the final target
model and snapshot are populated. Validation is focused valuation `42/42`,
the combined Inventory regression `87/87`, SQL Server safety `40/40`,
full disposable-LocalDB backend `961/961`, model-change detection clean, and
an isolated-output Release solution build with `0` warnings and `0` errors.

## Final Valuation-Integrity Remediation Delta

- **Tracking blocker isolation:** `missingPolicyBlockedBasePools` is reserved
  for unknown-scope `valuation_policy_not_configured` predecessors; known
  policies use `stoppedValuationScopes` keyed by the derived valuation scope.
  Tracking policies isolate LOT-A and LOT-B failures; non-tracking policies
  intentionally retain one combined Warehouse/Product/UOM pool.
- **Full-depletion closeout:** an outbound that reaches zero quantity closes
  the stored prior value, preserving formula movement value, rounding
  adjustment, actual movement value, and the zero quantity/value/average
  invariant. Partial outbound remains formula-based and does not close out.
- **Correction and Finance evidence:** full closeout correction restores the
  actual original amount, while Finance handoff preserves Direction,
  BaseUnitCost, absolute BaseAmount, SignedBaseAmount, and the rounding
  adjustment evidence.
- **Reconciliation fail-closed:** zero-quantity/non-zero-value and negative
  valuation state is reported as `ValuationMismatch`; summary completeness is
  false and partial when any row is mismatched.
- **Additive persistence:** migration
  `20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity` adds only the immutable
  formula/rounding evidence columns; prior MESP-131 migrations are unchanged.

Final evidence: focused valuation `42/42`; combined Inventory regression
`87/87`; SQL Server safety `40/40` against disposable LocalDB; full
disposable-LocalDB backend `961/961`, `0` failed, `0` skipped;
model-change detection clean;
isolated-output Release build `0` warnings and
`0` errors; Angular `254/254` across 35 spec files; focused Chromium `5/5`,
full Chromium `32/32`; initial production bundle `499.94 kB`; valuation lazy
chunk `35.96 kB`; and both npm audits at `0 vulnerabilities`.

## Final Runtime Verification

- Backend URL: `http://localhost:5300`; `/health`: HTTP 200; official launcher
  PID `16088` remains running.
- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:4300`; `/`: HTTP 200; Angular PID `43800`.
- Frontend `/main.js`: HTTP 200.
- Both repository-owned processes are alive for Owner inspection. No
  credentials were printed.
- `frontend/assets` has zero changes.

## Ledger Ordering

### Company Ledger Sequence

Every Inventory movement-producing path receives the next durable `long`
LedgerSequence from a Tenant + Company anchor. Valuation orders by
LedgerSequence and movement ID, never by PostedAt or EffectiveDate.

### Existing Movement Bootstrap

Migration `20260823124304_MESP131MovingWeightedAverageValuation` adds the
sequence and anchor, deterministically backfills existing rows by Tenant,
Company, PostedAt, and Id, then initializes each anchor to MAX + 1.

### Movement-Producing Paths

Opening Balance, Goods Receipt, Stock Adjustment, Inventory Count Variance,
Stock Issue, Supplier Return, Customer Return seam, Transfer Shipment,
Receipt, Loss, Return, and physical corrections use the same sequence path.

## Valuation Policy

### Scope

Tenant-owned, Company-specific, effective-dated, versioned policy. Scope is
Warehouse/Product/UOM or Warehouse/Product/UOM/TrackingIdentity.

### Functional Currency

Active Master Data currency identity and normalized code are server-validated;
policy/version/currency are snapshotted into state, evidence, handoff, report,
and export output.

### Precision / Rounding

Decimal-only calculations use bounded quantity/unit-cost/amount scales and
ToEven or AwayFromZero rounding. Negative state and over-issue are rejected.

### Goods Receipt Cost Basis

Authoritative Purchase Order line unit price and source currency are resolved
through Procurement; exact active effective-dated MESP-120 FX is required when
currencies differ. Client base cost is never authority.

### Return / Adjustment Policies

Supplier Return uses configured CurrentMovingAverage or LinkedReceiptValuation.
Positive Stock Adjustment and Inventory Count Variance use configured current
MWA. Customer Return without original delivery valuation remains Pending.

## MWA Engine

### Formula

Inbound: `Qnew=Qprior+Q`, `Vnew=Vprior+(Q*baseUnitCost)`. Outbound:
`Qnew=Qprior-Q`, `Vnew=Vprior-(Q*priorAverage)`. Average is `Vnew/Qnew`,
rounded by policy.

### Valuation State

Durable state is per Tenant/Company/Branch/Warehouse/Product/UOM/(tracking)/
physical valuation pool, never per policy version. It stores quantity, value,
average, last valued LedgerSequence, current policy metadata, currency,
timestamps, and concurrency token. Scope anchors use the same pool identity.

### Append-Only Evidence

Immutable events store source document/line/lineage, policy/currency/precision,
transaction cost, exchange-rate identity/version/scale/provenance, prior/new
state, movement value, status, correlation, actor, and occurrence time.

### Pending Predecessor

Missing policy/cost/FX, unresolved source, transfer shipment, or original
delivery evidence produces explicit Pending/Blocked evidence and later events
in the same scope do not leap over the stopped predecessor.

### Backdated Movements

Backdated EffectiveDate does not reorder the physical ledger. LedgerSequence
processing applies the event and records `backdated_applied` when appropriate.

## Source Valuation

- **Opening Balance:** source unit cost/currency with exact FX snapshot.
- **Goods Receipt:** Purchase Order line price and source currency.
- **Exchange Rate:** active exact source/target/effective MESP-120 version only;
  no inversion, default, or ambiguous rate.
- **Stock Adjustment:** configured current-MWA positive basis; outbound current
  average with non-negative state protection.
- **Inventory Count Variance:** MESP-130 physical movement, valued by the
  configured positive-adjustment/current-MWA rule; no accounting effect.
- **Stock Issue:** outbound current-MWA cost with source lineage.
- **Supplier Return:** current MWA or linked receipt evidence; missing link is
  Pending rather than fabricated cost.
- **Customer Return Boundary:** Sales-owned original delivery valuation is
  required; no Sales or AR implementation was added.

## Corrections

### Physical Correction Valuation

Corrections append a new linked movement. Full reversal uses original movement
value exactly; partial reversal is deterministic quantity pro-rata. The event
stores a signed reversal movement value.

### Valuation Source Revision

The correction API requires authoritative source-revision ID, reason,
antiforgery, idempotency, correlation, and audit. Persistence truthfully
returns `authoritative_source_revision_provider_required` until that provider
exists; prior evidence is never edited and cost is never invented.

### Immutable History

`CorrectionOfMovementId` and `CorrectionOfValuationEventId` link correction
history. History/export expose the chain without mutating the original event.

## Warehouse Transfer Valuation

Shipment is outbound source-warehouse MWA. In-transit is shipped less received
quantity and inherited shipment value. Receipt, loss, and return preserve
Transfer lineage and inherit shipment evidence; missing shipment valuation is
Pending.

## Concurrency / Idempotency

Serializable process transaction, durable scope anchors, optimistic tokens, and
actor + idempotency-key + request-fingerprint replay are implemented. A
concurrent valuation loser maps to a safe conflict. Mutations require
antiforgery, Idempotency-Key, correlation, server Tenant context, authorization,
audit, and safe errors. Client amounts, MWA values, base amounts, and FX are
not authority.

## Tenant / Company / Warehouse Authorization

Tenant is resolved from trusted server context. Policy, movement, state,
evidence, report, reconciliation, export, and handoff queries are
Tenant-filtered. Company/Branch/Warehouse access is server-authorized and
foreign scope fails closed without leakage; client Tenant IDs never authorize.

## Audit / History

Policy creation, process coordination, correction request, and CSV export
carry actor, correlation, idempotency, authorization path, and audit evidence.
History is immutable; export is bounded to 10,000 rows and records filters.

## Finance Handoff Boundary

Applied evidence emits `ReadyForFinance` facts under
`inventory-valuation-finance.v1`, with source/policy/currency/cost/amount/FX,
evidence ID/version, sequence, and correlation. Pending/NotConfigured/
ReadyForFinance are explicit. Inventory creates no journal, GL, AP, AR, tax,
payment, period, or financial reversal effect.

## Reconciliation

Inventory-owned reconciliation compares physical on-hand with valued quantity
and exposes valued amount, MWA cost, eligible/applied/pending/blocked counts,
latest physical and valued sequences, oldest pending sequence, in-transit
quantity/value, Finance handoff state, policy/currency, as-of, and freshness.
Statuses include Reconciled, PendingValuation, Blocked, QuantityMismatch, and
FinanceHandoffPending. No balancing plug is returned.

## Inventory Valuation Reports

The bounded views are Summary, MWA Cost History, Pending/Blocked, Inventory
Reconciliation, In-Transit Valuation, Finance Handoff, and correction history
through the immutable history chain. Filters cover Company, Branch, Warehouse,
Product, UOM, Tracking, source type, status, policy, currency, effective date,
and LedgerSequence.

## Export

`GET /api/v1/inventory/valuation/export` is Tenant-authorized and returns a
bounded CSV containing filters, as-of, freshness, functional currency,
policy/version, generated actor/correlation, and immutable event evidence. It
creates an `inventory.valuation.export` audit row and no public link or
external-storage artifact.

## EN / AR / RTL

Lazy `/app/inventory/valuation` extends Inventory with summary, history,
pending/blocked, reconciliation, in-transit, handoff, blocked/as-of/freshness,
and export controls. It uses server-provided warehouse context, supports EN/AR
labels and RTL, and has no raw GUID entry.

## API / OpenAPI

Catalogue-backed operation IDs cover policy, process, state, history,
summary, pending, reconciliation, in-transit, export, Finance handoff, and
correction seams. Safe problem responses and Tenant scope are documented; the
export is a file response.

## Migration / Legacy Bootstrap / SQL Safety

Formal migrations: `20260823124304_MESP131MovingWeightedAverageValuation`,
the additive remediation `20260823180537_MESP131SolFinancialIntegrityRemediation`,
and final additive evidence migration
`20260823225921_MESP131SolFinalValuationIntegrity`.
Legacy sequence bootstrap is deterministic and evidence is preserved. The
remediation migration is separate and the original MESP-131 migration remains
unchanged. The disposable SQL Server LocalDB safety harness passed the final
source with schema, ownership, migration, sequence, concurrency, and valuation
checks. No production SQL/provider/cutover decision was made.

## Validation Totals

- Focused MESP-131 valuation: `34/34`.
- Prior Inventory regression (ledger + stock control + valuation): `52/52`.
- SQL Server safety harness: `40/40` against disposable LocalDB (previous
  baseline `39`).
- Full backend LocalDB harness: `953/953`, `0` failed, `0` skipped.
- Release solution build: `0` warnings, `0` errors using isolated output so
  the Owner runtime's in-place Release assemblies remained locked and intact.
- Angular: `254/254` across 35 spec files.
- Production bundle: initial `499.94 kB`; valuation lazy `35.96 kB`; no
  initial-budget warning.
- Focused Playwright: `5/5`; full Playwright: `32/32`.
- Both npm audit modes: `0` vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: checked before the documentation handoff commit.

## Runtime Verification

Backend `http://localhost:5300`, PID `15844`; frontend
`http://localhost:4300`, PID `12120`. Backend health, frontend root, and
`main.js` each returned HTTP 200. The existing Owner launcher processes were
preserved without restart during this migration-only session and remain
running for Owner inspection. Loopback-only Development auth bypass was used
without printing or persisting credentials.

## Known Limitations / Deferred Finance Policy

- Authoritative revised-source persistence is a provider-required seam and is
  intentionally unavailable; correction never fabricates valuation.
- Finance owns GL mapping, account/period validation, balanced journals,
  subledger reconciliation, AP/AR, corrections, and reversals; MESP-132+ owns
  that work.
- Formal migration is source evidence only; production SQL/provider,
  backup/restore, retention, legal, capacity, DNS/TLS, and cutover gates stay
  open.
- No generic Reporting platform, Sales integration, external/statutory
  submission, automated FX, supplier portal, or Wafra-specific core behavior.

## Exact Next Action

Superseded by the guarded merge handoff at the top of this file. Sol now
verifies merged main, records final MESP-131 Jira closure, moves MESP-131 to
Done, reconciles MESP-8, evaluates/activates MESP-132, and issues the next

## Bounded final delta

- Full Count now establishes a durable warehouse movement-cardinality fence
  inside the Serializable persistence transaction before it reads the
  authoritative ledger identity universe. The identity universe, explicitly
  requested identities, anchor acquisition, expected quantities, cutoff, and
  count lines are resolved in the same transaction. A post-fence movement that
  would introduce a new warehouse identity is therefore blocked until the
  snapshot boundary is complete and cannot be silently omitted.
- Cycle Count remains selected-identity scoped. It records a movement
  cardinality for each selected `Company/Branch/Warehouse/Product/UOM/
  TrackingIdentity`; movement on an unrelated identity remains irrelevant.
- Full Count and Cycle Count movement-cardinality values are persisted as
  `long`/SQL Server `bigint`. Each count generation has an append-only
  `inventory.CountSnapshots` evidence row, and each current count line carries
  its identity cardinality. Recount and resnapshot create new generation rows
  and preserve prior snapshot evidence; they do not overwrite old fence data.
- Posting no longer treats `PostedAt > SnapshotCutoff` as the stale-detection
  authority. It compares the current durable generation fence with the live
  warehouse or selected-identity ledger cardinality and fails closed when the
  generation evidence is absent or changed, returning `ResnapshotRequired`
  without creating a variance movement.
- The formal additive Inventory EF migration is
  `20260823104702_MESP130InventoryCountLedgerFence`, after all existing
  MESP-130 migrations. It adds the fence columns and `CountSnapshots` only;
  it does not alter unrelated model columns or ownership boundaries.
- Deterministic SQL Server regressions pause after the real authoritative
  reader has executed, then prove the concurrent insert is blocked while the
  count transaction holds the fence. Full Count explicitly proves Product B
  has `PostedAt` earlier than the eventual cutoff, is not in the snapshot, and
  still forces `ResnapshotRequired`. Cycle Count proves the same selected-
  identity behavior while unrelated identities remain irrelevant.

## Required acceptance evidence — completed

- Focused Inventory Stock Control tests: `12/12` passed.
- SQL Server safety suite: `32/32` passed through a disposable LocalDB
  `MiniErpFoundation_*` catalog; no persistent runtime database connection was
  used by the safety harness.
- Full backend suite: `911/911` passed, `0` failed, `0` skipped.
- Release solution build: `0` warnings, `0` errors.
- Angular unit tests: `246/246` across `33` spec files.
- Focused MESP-130 Chromium journey: `1/1` passed.
- Full Chromium suite: `27/27` passed.
- Production bundle: initial `499.81 kB`; Inventory lazy chunk `90.11 kB`;
  Supplier Quotation lazy chunk `91.94 kB`; no initial-budget warning.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`: `0` vulnerabilities.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`: `0` vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: clean for the source/test/migration delta; final
  documentation diff is checked before the handoff commit.
- `frontend/assets`: zero changes; Owner-managed source assets were not
  deleted, renamed, replaced, regenerated, optimized, recolored, moved, or
  restored.

## Runtime left for Owner inspection

The official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` launcher was used
after the final Release build. It selected the safe fallback API port because
the generic port 5000 was occupied:

- Backend: `http://localhost:5300`, PID `31576`; `GET /health` returned HTTP
  `200`.
- Frontend: `http://localhost:4300`, PID `40296`; `GET /` and `GET /main.js`
  returned HTTP `200`.
- Both repository-owned processes were verified alive after the checks and are
  left running.
- The explicit loopback-only Development auth bypass was used. No password or
  other credential was printed or persisted.

## Preserved boundaries

MESP-130 remains Pending-valuation for new physical effects and creates no
Finance, GL, AP, AR, tax, payment, Sales, Reporting, MWA, external, statutory,
ZATCA/FATOORA, DNS/TLS, production-provider, migration/cutover, supplier
portal, or Wafra-specific core behavior. MESP-131 owns MWA valuation.
Unsupported physical sources remain uncorrectable. Return-for-change is not
exposed because this bounded UI has no edit/resubmit contract.

## Exact next action

Sol performs final acceptance against the exact final branch tip and Draft PR
`#74`, then the Owner decides whether to merge. Do not start another
implementation task automatically. No Opus review prompt is created by this
handoff.

## Architecture delivered

- **Company books:** Finance is Company/legal-entity scoped inside a trusted
  Tenant. Each Company owns its COA, functional currency, Fiscal Calendar,
  Fiscal Years, Periods, journals, GL facts, posting rules, and reconciliation
  state. No universal Tenant currency is inferred; SAR is only an explicit
  Company fixture/configuration value.
- **COA:** normalized code, Tenant + Company uniqueness, English/optional
  Arabic name, parent, Asset/Liability/Equity/Revenue/Expense type, posting
  eligibility, currency behavior, effective dates, lifecycle, concurrency and
  historical account snapshots.
- **Hierarchy:** same-Company parent validation, self-parent rejection,
  ancestry-cycle protection and deterministic account ordering. No customer
  account seed or Wafra code is authoritative.
- **Fiscal Calendar / Year / Period:** Finance-owned Company Calendar with
  explicit Year boundaries and non-overlapping Periods inside one Year.
  Period lifecycle is Draft, Open, SoftClosed, Closed; posting date resolves
  to exactly one period and missing/ambiguous resolution fails closed.
- **Year-end boundary:** no retained-earnings, automatic P&L close,
  carry-forward, equity mapping, or opening journal mechanic was fabricated.
- **Cost Center:** approved bounded Finance dimension. Repository inspection
  found no existing persisted Master Data Cost Center to reuse, so the narrow
  Company-applicable `finance.CostCenters` structure is Finance-owned. It is
  lifecycle/effective-dated and server-authorized; no other dimensions were
  invented.
- **Journal / Lines:** Finance-owned Journal and Journal Lines preserve dates,
  Company/functional/transaction currency, FX evidence, source lineage,
  posting-rule identity/version, actors, correlation, reason, status, version,
  account/dimension snapshots, debit/credit and functional amounts.
- **Lifecycle:** Draft -> Submitted -> Approved -> Posted, with Rejected and
  Cancelled before posting. Posting is separate from approval. Posted facts
  are immutable.
- **Balance invariant:** at least two lines; each line has exactly one positive
  economic side; no negatives, both-sides, zero lines, suspense plug or
  automatic balancing. Debit and credit must balance exactly in functional
  currency after server FX validation.
- **Post / reversal:** post validates Company, account, effective date,
  posting eligibility, required dimension, exact period, rule determinism,
  source uniqueness, and balance. Reversal creates a separate equal-and-
  opposite Posted Journal, links the original, requires reason and eligible
  period, and never mutates/deletes the original.
- **Posting Rules:** Company-owned source/event mapping with monotonic version,
  effective window, enabled/disabled lifecycle, debit/credit accounts and
  Cost Center requiredness. Zero applicable rules are Pending Mapping;
  multiple applicable rules are Ambiguous Mapping; no arbitrary rule choice.
- **Multi-currency / MESP-120:** functional currency is the book balance;
  transaction currency is preserved. Foreign currency requires exact active
  direct MESP-120 Exchange Rate ID, Version ID, Version Number, rate, pair,
  effective window and provenance. No inverse/latest/browser/external rate.
- **MESP-131 handoff:** Finance consumes `inventory-valuation-finance.v1`
  ReadyForFinance evidence, maps through one exact rule, creates/posts the
  journal, records source lineage and durable uniqueness, and does not mutate
  Inventory valuation or physical movement.
- **Security:** trusted Tenant/Company context, exact operation permission,
  reusable approval/SoD seams, antiforgery, safe errors, If-Match concurrency,
  durable actor/key/fingerprint replay, Serializable transactions and audit.
- **Angular:** lazy `/app/finance` Company-selected COA, periods, journals,
  posting rules, Inventory handoff and GL inquiry; server selectors only,
  EN/AR, RTL, accessible/responsive UI, no raw GUID entry.

## Validation evidence

- Focused Finance tests: `5/5`, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- REST/OpenAPI and host-security subset: `52/52`.
- Prior Inventory regression: `89/89`.
- SQL Server safety: `41/41` against disposable LocalDB; this is one case
  above the accepted `40/40` baseline.
- Full backend wrapper `scripts/Test-MiniErpBackend.ps1 -NoBuild:$false`:
  `969/969`, 0 failed, 0 skipped; the disposable database was torn down and
  the runtime connection remained unchanged.
- Release solution build: 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- EF Finance model-change check: no changes since the last migration.
- Finance migration Designer: populated `BuildTargetModel` confirmed.
- Angular unit tests: `258/258` across 37 spec files.
- Production bundle: initial `496.34 kB`; Finance lazy chunk `36.60 kB`; no
  initial-budget warning.
- Focused Finance Playwright: `2/2`; full Chromium: `34/34`.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` and `npm audit`: 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: clean after final documentation changes.
- `frontend/assets`: zero changes.

## Deferred scope

AP, AR, supplier/customer invoices, payments, receipts, allocations,
settlement, cash/bank, tax/VAT, ZATCA/FATOORA, financial statements, generic
Reporting, P&L/Balance Sheet/Cash Flow, AP/AR aging, consolidation,
intercompany, fixed assets, payroll, treasury, budgeting, automated FX feeds,
period-end revaluation, production migration/opening-balance execution,
cutover, external providers, statutory certification, Sales, and Wafra-
specific Finance behavior were not started.

## Final runtime verification

The official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` launcher was run
after the final Release build with the explicit loopback-only Development auth
bypass. Backend URL `http://localhost:5300`, PID `41320`, health HTTP 200.
Frontend URL `http://localhost:4300`, PID `5432`, root HTTP 200, `main.js`
HTTP 200, and lazy Finance route `/app/finance` HTTP 200. Both
repository-owned processes remain running for Owner inspection. No password or
other credential was printed or persisted.

## Exact next action

Sol verifies the exact final branch SHA and the single Draft PR, then accepts
or returns the bounded MESP-132 implementation. Do not merge, mark Ready,
rebase, force-push, create another PR, invoke Opus, or start MESP-133+ or

# MESP-135 - Sol HOLD 6 final bounded handoff - 27 August 2026

This is the complete bounded handoff for the final HOLD 6 remediation on the
existing `feat/MESP-135-finance-close-reports` branch and Draft PR #79. The
exact mandatory preflight was preserved: feature start and remote feature
`243199b22b1762f0797d19702577b874429dabaf`; `origin/main`
`0d1485d4a2197f23250b1d5acc1a00ddf26dc4c9`; merge-base
`841a777af1622cb4de9c3708cd4a2b389b7ef9e9`; and the only main-only change was
`A docs/Mini_ERP_SaaS_Platform_Project_Presentation.pptx` with blob
`cce3723f374dc5ffe3ff872f73efae247a90b886`. The remote archive remains
`0099a9a02eff490753f7c4565651fc54e1368453`, the local recovery archive remains
`284e59661e159cf2a14ea802f7e18e3fadb8d384`, and the PPTX is absent from the
feature tree. No rebase, main merge, copy, restore, or force-push occurred.

## HOLD 6 implementation

The source/test commit is
`69b20b3c0dbba2a7f3b6c5ade2a19f63ad7fb9bb`.
`FinanceMesp135Persistence` now consumes the effective MESP-134 unrealized-FX
reconciliation result at the exact period-end as-of date. Persisted
period-end lines are not active merely because they exist. A uniquely
identified `Reconciled` row is active; a valid `Reversed` row remains
historical evidence but is inactive for current coverage. A replacement must
be the only active reconciled candidate for a non-zero source. A valid
reversed line may remain for a current zero-effect source, but unexpected
active zero-effect evidence blocks. Missing, broken, duplicate, stale, extra,
unresolved, cross-Company, and cross-Tenant evidence fails closed.

Reconciliation identity binds Tenant-filtered Company, source type and ID,
batch, line, original journal, and exact reversal lineage. Reconciled evidence
cannot carry reversal lineage; reversed evidence must carry the exact persisted
reversal journal. The deterministic Close fingerprint includes the
authoritative scope, effective active candidates, and unresolved evidence,
while excluding valid reversed historical rows from current coverage. No
public endpoint, entity, DbContext, configuration, schema, migration, or
`frontend/assets` file changed.

## HOLD 6 regressions

- `Hold6_REPLACE01_valid_reversed_revaluation_is_inactive_while_replacement_is_the_only_active_candidate` proves real reversal plus replacement leaves exactly one active candidate and changes the readiness fingerprint deterministically.
- `Hold6_ZERO_REV01_valid_reversed_stale_evidence_is_allowed_when_the_authoritative_source_is_zero_effect` proves a valid reversed historical line is allowed after the current source becomes zero-effect and no fake revaluation journal is created.
- `Hold6_BROKEN_REV01_unresolved_reversal_evidence_remains_fail_closed` proves missing reversal journal lineage maps to unresolved MESP-134 evidence and blocks readiness.
- `Hold6_DUP_ACTIVE01_two_active_reconciled_candidates_for_one_source_block_readiness` proves duplicate active candidates block.
- `Hold6_EXTRA_ACTIVE01_active_evidence_for_a_current_zero_effect_source_is_extra_and_blocks` proves active evidence for a zero-effect source blocks.
- `Hold6_TENANT_COMPANY_ISOLATION_effective_candidates_cannot_cross_tenant_or_company_boundaries` proves out-of-scope Company/Tenant evidence cannot satisfy the authorized source.
- `Revaluation_readiness_snapshot_at_period_end_is_stable_across_a_later_revaluation_reversal` now directly asserts the MESP-134 period-end reconciliation remains `Reconciled` with the original journal and no reversal ID after a later reversal.

## Final validation evidence

- Release build: **0 warnings / 0 errors**.
- Focused backend: MESP-133 settlement **22/22**; MESP-134 **27/27**;
  MESP-135 **31/31**.
- Full canonical disposable-LocalDB backend runner:
  **1,098/1,098 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The persistent
  `MESP_SQLSERVER_CONNECTION_STRING` was not used for destructive tests; the
  disposable database was removed and the orphan proof passed.
- SQL safety: **80/80**, including the three MESP-135 races
  `Close04_Concurrent_reopen_and_post_preserve_one_coherent_period_state`,
  `Year03_Concurrent_year_end_post_and_late_journal_cannot_commit_stale_year_end`,
  `Corr03_Concurrent_correction_and_period_close_preserve_close_snapshot`,
  and the MESP-134 revaluation contention cases. Focused HOLD6/MESP-134 SQL
  filter: **14/14**.
- REST/OpenAPI/host security: **55/55**. Public operation catalogue remains
  **383 public / 2 internal**; HOLD 6 adds no operation.
- EF Core: Infrastructure design-time `has-pending-model-changes` reports
  **No changes have been made to the model since the last migration**; no
  migration was generated or edited.
- Angular: **296/296** across 41 spec files; production initial bundle
  **496.45 kB**, Finance/GL **34.52 kB**, settlements **56.04 kB**, tax-fx
  **40.38 kB**, reports **17.02 kB**, close **16.28 kB**.
- Browser: focused Finance Chromium **15/15**; full Chromium **47/47**.
- Security: `npm audit` **0 vulnerabilities**;
  `npm audit --omit=dev` **0 vulnerabilities**; NuGet vulnerable-package scan
  clear for all five projects.
- Runtime: official `scripts/Start-MiniErpDevelopment.ps1 -Restart` left API
  PID **38772** on `http://localhost:5300` and Angular PID **8036** on
  `http://localhost:4300`. `/health`, `/openapi/v1.json`, `/`, `/main.js`,
  `/app/finance`, `/app/finance/ap`, `/app/finance/ar`,
  `/app/finance/settlements`, `/app/finance/tax-fx`, `/app/finance/close`,
  and `/app/finance/reports` all returned HTTP 200. **LEFT RUNNING = YES**.
- `frontend/assets` is untouched; `docs/statistics.md` was not created.

## Governance and stop condition

MESP-135 remains **In Progress** and is still the only active Finance
capability. MESP-139 remains inactive; MESP-48 and MESP-50 remain open
production gates; accepted fast-track remains **18/26 = 69.2%**; and
production readiness remains approximately **47% overall / 41% Procurement/P2P**.
No Jira write, Opus review, Ready transition, merge, rebase, force-push, or
second PR occurred. The final feature head is the pushed documentation-sync
head containing this handoff, with the exact SHA reported by
`git rev-parse HEAD` after the documentation commit. Stop for independent
GPT-5.6 Sol HOLD 6 acceptance; do not mark PR #79 Ready, merge, or start
MESP-139 or another capability.
